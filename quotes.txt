Day 363. The terror continues.  Also, made another soufflÃ©. Very nearly.  Checked defences.  They came again last night. It's still always at night. Maybe they're vampires.
Oh, and it's my Mum's birthday. Happy birthday, Mum. I did make you a soufflÃ©, but it was too beautiful to live.
Hello?
Hello, yes, yes, sorry, do you read me?!
Hello! Are you real? Are you actually, properly real?
Oswin Oswald, Junior Entertainment Manager, Starship Alaska. Current status - crashed and shipwrecked somewhere... not nice. Been here a year, rest of the crew missing. Provisions good, but keen to move on.
Some local life-forms, I've been keeping them out.
I know a Dalek when I hear one, yeah.
Making soufflÃ©s.
No, hello... hello!
Sorry, sorry! Pressed the wrong switch.
Could always call me Oswin, seeing as that's my name. You OK?
Well it's very easy to hack.
Ship broke up when it hit. Somewhere underground, I think. You coming to get me?
Hello!
'Unauthorised personnel may not enter the cockpit.'
Ooh, Mr Grumpy! Bad combo! No sense of humour and that chin.
Careful, dear, you'll put someone's eye out. I'm scanning you. You're on another of the escape pods from the Alaska, right? Same ship I was on.
Long story. Is there a word for total screaming genius that sounds modest and a tiny bit sexy?
I see what you did there. Check the floor. I'm picking up a breach at floor level, there could be a way out. See you later!
Run! The door at the end, run for it! They're waking up but they're slow. The door at the end, just run. Now, now, now!
So anyway. I'm Oswin. What do I call you?
Lovely name, Rory. First boy I ever fancied was called Rory.
Actually, she was called Nina, I was going through a phase. Just flirting to keep you cheerful.
Hey there, beaky boy.
Loving this - the nose and the chin. You two could fence. There's a door behind you.
In there, quickly. OK, you're safe for now. Pop your shirt off, quick as you like.
Does there have to be a reason?
Hello, the Chin! I have visual on you!
Limited power, bad hair, take your pick. There's a door to your left, open it.  Going to send you a map to that screen. I've put your little friend somewhere safe, I can get you to him.
I call him Nina. It's a personal thing - hush now.
10, 20, hard to say. Some of them are catatonic, but they do have firepower.
You'd better hope so. Because pretty soon, she's going to try and kill you.
Do you know how you make someone into a Dalek? Subtract love, add anger. Doesn't she seem a bit too angry to you?
I mentioned the genius thing, yeah? I'm shielded in here.
Well, I've had nearly a year to mess with them and not a lot else to do.
So, Doctor, I've been looking you up. You're all over the Database. Why do the Daleks call you the Predator?
You've got a plan?
Yeah, got it on the sensors.
Pretty fast. But why would I?
Yeah. Internal use only.
I can do it from here. As soon as you come and get me.
There's enough power in that teleport for one go. Why would you wait for me?
No idea, never met you. Sending you a map so you can come get me.
Yeah. Kind of why I'm anxious to leave. Come up and see me some time.
You are. Less than 20 feet away. Which is the good news...
You're about to pass through intensive care.
Dunno. Survivors of particular wars. Spiridon. Kembel. Aridius. Vulcan. Exxilon. Ringing any bells?
Yeah? How?
That's weird. Those ones don't usually wake up for anything.
Hang on, not quite sure â€“  there's a release code, let me, let me just... Anything happening out there?
Hang on, I'm trying a thing.
I can't!
Oh, that is cool. Tell me I'm cool, chin boy.
Hang on, I think I've found the door thingie...
The Daleks, they have a hive mind. Well they don't, but they have a telepathic web.
I hacked into it. Did a master delete on all the information connected with the Doctor.
Good, eh? And here comes the door!
Come and meet the girl who can.
Hey! You're right outside, come on in.
No, we don't! Don't even say that. Joined the Alaska to see the universe, ended up stuck in a shipwreck, first time out.  Rescue me, chin boy, and show me the stars.
Does what look real?
It IS real.
Where am I?
Where... am... I? Where... am... I?
I am not a Dalek! I am NOT a Dalek! I'm human.
Where am I? Where am I? Where am I?
I'm... human...
Where am I? Where am I? Where am I?
Eggs.
I'm... human... I am not a Dalek... I am human, I am not Dalek. I am human!
Eggs.
I am a Dalek! I am a Dalek!
Eggs... term... in... ate.
Eggs... term... in... ate. Exterminate! Exterminate!
EXTERMINATE! EXTERMINATE!
Why do they hate you...
...so much? They hate you so much. Why?
We have grown stronger in fear of you.
Then run.
I've taken down the force-field. The Daleks above have begun their attack. Run!
I am Oswin Oswald. I fought the Daleks. And I AM... human. Remember me.
Run!
Run, you clever boy and remember...
Wait, are they saying something?
A new ghost, oh, no, no, no, no...
Yeah, not exactly like... But, yeah, once or twice.
That it will be all right. That the Doctor will save us.
Yeah. Yeah, I do.
Who's Prentis?
It's the Doctor.
For the moment.
Doctor? Doctor, are you all right?
Another ghost has appeared.
Doctor... it's you. Are you OK?
What does it mean?
No, not necessarily. We can change the sequence of events so...
No. You can change things.
! Die with whoever comes after me. You do  leave .
I'm not ready yet. I don't want to think about that, not yet.
So break them. And anyway, you owe me. You've made yourself essential to me. You've given me something else to to be. And you can't do that and then die. It's not fair.
No. Doctor, I don't care about your rules or your bloody survivor's guilt. If you love me in any way, you'll come back. Doctor, are you...?
No... but like you said, if you can find out why this is happening, maybe you can stop them killing anybody else, you can save us. And you can stop it happening to you.
No, nothing. You're the same as all the other ghosts with the weird black eyes and... No. No, wait. Your coat. It's torn. The right shoulder.
No. You're saying a list of names. Our names, mainly. "Moran, Pritchard, Prentis, O'Donnell, Clara, Doctor, Bennett, Cass." Who's Prentis?
You've moved inside. You're inside here now.
Er, nothing. You're, you're just standing there.
No, wait, you're moving, going toward the control panel.
Oh, no. He's opened the Faraday Cage. He's let the other ghosts out.
Didn't you hear me? You opened the Faraday Cage. The other ghosts are outside. Shouldn't we be hiding?
OK, Doctor, you're on.
Erm... Er... you've just stopped. Oh, no, wait, you've started again.
What?
Problem? What problem? Oh, really? Because everything else is going so smoothly...
OK, how long are you going to...?
O'Donnell's dead.
Oh, no. No, no, no, no, don't you dare... Don't you dare...
The dark. The sword. The forsaken. The temple. When we found out what the ghosts were saying, we weren't surprised because the words, they were already inside us.
But you, you were, weren't you? You didn't know what the words were going to be.
Who was the one person who  see the writing in the spaceship?
That's why the ghosts didn't hurt you when they had the chance. The message isn't inside you.
So you can get the phone back.
Listen, listen. I need... We, we need to be able to contact the Doctor and you are the only one who can do this.
What? What is it? What did she say?
Please.
He taught me to do what has to be done. You should get going.
Look, he'll be fine, I promise.
OK. Didn't need anyone to translate that.
Hey, no, no, no, no. Cass! Wait, what are you doing? Look, Lunn, he is going to be fine, I promise. We have to stay here. I know that look. I  that look. OK, fine. But we stick together.
Lunn. Lunn. Lunn. Oh, Cass. Cass. Cass. Idiot. I'm an idiot.
Oh, there you are.
Come on. Faraday Cage now!
Back, get back.
Doctor?
What's that noise?
Where are they going? So what was it? Your ghost.
Why did they only come out at night?
I do. You keep going. You have to. Take it from me, there is a whole world out there. A galaxy, a life. What would O'Donnell have wanted?
What will UNIT do with the ghosts?
Here's what I don't understand. You  change the future. You stopped the Fisher King from returning.
And saying the chamber will open?
Smart.
How do you mean?
OK, that's still pretty smart.
Well, it must have been... Wow.
Not Vegas then!
A sinking submarine?
Just listen to him, for God's sake!
Are we going to be ok?
Is that a lie?
Isn't it always like that?
Doctor!
Think so.
We were sinking...
What happened?
No, what happened to the TARDIS, I mean?
What does it matter how we arrived? The important thing is to get...
…out.
Doctor!
Doctor!
What is it, then?
Doctor!
They're scared? I'm scared!
You... know him?
Oh, yeah, very nice. He sounds lovely.
Like with the cattle prod thing?
Is he that dangerous?
Eh?
Pretty bad spies, mate. I don't even speak Russian!
I don't... Am I speaking Russian? How come I'm speaking Russian?
Are they speaking Russian?
Are they?
Well, there really is only one choice, isn't there? I don't smell of anything... To my knowledge.
Yeah.
Grand Marshal Skaldak.
Ok?
&quot;Sovereign of the Tharsisian caste. By the moons, I honour thee.&quot;
Grand Marshal, I'm... We're sorry about this.
It isn't what you deserve.
Oh! Oh, great.
You're a long way from home.
And 5,000 years adrift in time. Please, let us help you. You're not our enemy.
Doctor, what do I say?
I heard that.
I'm ok.
I'm ok! Doctor, something's wrong.
Something's...
It's not there! It's gone!
It's got out!
Come on!
I'm ok. Ha-ha, I'm ok, I'm ok! Where did he go?
How did I do? Was I ok?
I know but...
Really?
Even if a missile did get launched, that wouldn't be... it, would it?
End of the world. Game over. I mean, what if they fired one by accident, what would happen then?
But the world didn't end in 1983, did it? Or I wouldn't be here.
Is it true you've never seen one outside of its shell suit?
So, why have you got a cattle prod on a submarine?
Ah, right.
I'd swap one for an Ice Warrior any day. Cuddlier!
What?
Yes, that would work... if this was
What?
I'm not singing a song!
What was that?
I'm not singing!
‘Course I know it. We do it at karaoke. The odd hen night.
Ok.
I'm not!
I was doing ok. I mean, I went in there and did the scary stuff, didn't I? I went in there with the Ice Warrior and it went ok. Actually, it went just about as badly as it could have done but that wasn't my fault.
So, I'm happy about that.
Chuffed.
Seeing those bodies back there... It's all got very... real. Are we going to make it?
What was that?
Stuff. You know, stuff.
Yes.
I can't.
I'm not allowed.
I can't!
Funny. You're funny!
No, please, don't hurt him. Please!
How did it do that?
Why did you hesitate? Back there, in the dark. You were going to kill this man, remember? I begged you not to and you listened. Why show compassion then, Skaldak, and not now?  The Doctor's right. Billions will die... Mothers, sons, fathers... daughters. Remember that last battle, Skaldak? Your daughter... You sang the songs...
What's happening?!
We did it! We did it!
Da-da-da-dah I'm lost and I'm found and I'm hungry like the wolf.
Saved the world then?
That's what we do.
The TARDIS! Where's the TARDIS? You never explained.
Stop saying that! Where is it?
Know what?
What did you do?
Huh?
The what?
Oh, Doctor.
Brilliant!
Not far then.
Ah.
You're making a habit of this. Getting us lost.
What for?
The name. Sweetville.
Why not name it after yourself? After all, it's your creation.
Doctor?
Hi.  What's going on?
Doctor, I've been thinking, the chimney...
Yeah, but the chimney...
A chimney that doesn't blow smoke.
Missed me?
With that, I should think.
What is it?
I'm...  I'm a friend, a friend of his.
So when do we get to meet him, this silent partner of yours? Why's he so shy?
Doctor... What is it?
And wiping us all out! You can't!
Experimented?
God!
Yeah? I've got a chair!
She wouldn't!
What's it doing?
Was there any particular reason?
Yeah. Maybe had enough Victorian values for a bit.
Am I?
The boss, yep, that's me!
I am the boss.
Of course it's not.
No, it's just someone who looks like me.
That's not right.
No, I was in Victorian Yorkshire.
Can you have a what?!
No, no, no! Listen...
Shut up, shut up, shut up. I need to talk to you.
No, no, Not while you're in the room.
Shut up!
Stay shut up.
Not all of them good.
...better when you're here, but maybe... Maybe not this. OK. Um... OK, before all of that. Before all of the stuff...
I love you.
No, not like that. Not like it's automatic.
Not like it's how you end the phone call, the sign off, the pat on the back.
Danny, I'll never say those words again. Not to anybody else, ever. Those words, from me, are yours now.
So, er. That's a thing.
OK, Danny? Er, there's more but that's kind of the headline. OK, Danny, please speak to me, This is, this is killing me.
Danny, I love you. And you are the last person who's ever going to hear me say that.
Hello? Er, yeah. Who's this?
Oh. Um, OK. Er... Can you please just put me back on the phone to Danny? I was talking to Danny.
OK, er, what are you sorry about? Could you please just pass the phone back to
Of what?
It wasn't terrible.
It was boring.
It was ordinary.  People just kept walking with their iPods and their shopping bags. He was alive, and then he was dead and it was nothing. Like stepping off a bus.
I don't deserve anything. Nobody deserves anything. But I am owed better. I am owed.
Hey!
Oh, nothing. You know, same old, same old.
Start her up.
Away.
Just away.
A volcano.
I've never seen an active volcano, do you know one?
I've never seen lava.
Prove it.
It's on your neck.
Do you still have those sleep patch things?
I'm having trouble sleeping.
Can I have one?
You told me once what it would take to destroy a TARDIS key. That's what's so good about lava. All seven. From all of your hiding places.
Do I have your attention?
Good.
Danny Pink.
Is dead.
Seriously?
And fix it. Change it. Change what happened. Save him. Bring him back.
Five left. Every time you say no to me, I will throw another key down there. Do we understand each other?
Time can be rewritten.
Did you just say no?
Yes?
I have seen you change time, I have seen you break any rule you want.
I know what you're doing. You're trying to take control.
No!
Do you know what, Doctor? When it comes to taking control, you really are out of your depth.
One last chance. And I don't care about the rules, I don't give a damn about paradoxes. Save Danny. Bring him back or I swear you will never step inside your TARDIS again.
Do as you are told.
Say it again so I know you mean it.
I'm not kidding, Doctor.
I will do it!
Oh, I'd say I'm sorry but I'd do it again.
I'd do it again. Well, what are you doing? Why are you just standing there? Do you understand what I have just done?
There's nothing in my hand.
The keys, they're gone. They're down there. They've gone.
There's nothing in my hand.
Well, now you know.
I love him.
So, what now? What do we do now? You and me, what happens now? Doctor?
Fair enough. Absolutely fair enough.
You're going to help me?
Because of what I just did. I just...
Then why are you helping me?
What moments?
We ended up all over Danny's timestream.
Doctor...
I don't deserve a friend like you.
Where are we?
But this is where Danny is?
What won't?
Are you forgetting why we're here?
Fish tanks?
What does that mean?
Why?
OK, I'm assuming they didn't actually drown in there.
With chairs?
Oh, God. Am I going to find Danny now? Is that why the TARDIS brought us here? I don't want to see him like that.
OK. Bit strange?
Is what difficult?
Browsing.
Yeah. Great.
I think it's over, yeah.
Oh, I'm good, thanks. No worries.
Missy?
Tongues?
Maybe just a tad, yeah.
Hello.
You can probably take your hand down now, Doctor.
Condolences?
Yes. Yes, there is.
No.
A reading?
What won't?
Are you serious? X-ray water?
Doesn't matter. 3W, what kind of name is that? What does it mean?
What three words?
Speak for me again, I'll detach something from you. I'll be fine.
OK, people, voices.
Shut up, Doctor.
Don't say it.
What's that beeping?
Danny! I can hear you. Is that you?
I don't, I don't understand. What is happening?
It was him. It was his voice.
Yes, Danny, I can hear you. Can you hear me?
Hang on just a moment.
Where are you going?
Danny?
Danny, I'm so sorry but I'm going to have to ask you some questions.
Then what was the name of the restaurant? What was it?
Tell me something only Danny would know.
No. No, no, no. I'm sorry, but no. Anybody could say that. Anybody would know to say that. Say something only you could tell me. Prove to me you are really Danny.
I love you means nothing right now.
Not until I know who's talking. Say something only Danny could say.
Wherever you are...
Whatever it takes, I will be with you again, I swear.
Nothing in the world, as soon as I know it's you.
Stop saying that! Don't say that. If you say that again, I swear I will switch this thing off.
Doctor!
"Waste no more time arguing about what a good man should be. Be one." Marcus Aurelius.
Have you been running?
Did he leave an address?
Will there be cocktails?
The moon'll do!
No. Learn anything?
What's happening?
Doctor?!
Ah! Doctor!
That probably sounded better in his head.
The Queen? The First? Sorry, Elizabeth the First?
Did you know her? Elizabeth the First?
Sorry?
What, like you?
You have a job?!
You don't have a job!
You never have a job.
But... but that's not possible.
Obviously.
But how is it doing that? How is that possible?  It's an oil painting... in 3D.
You OK?
Who was?
I don't understand.
Elizabeth the First? You knew her, then?
Someday, you could just walk past a fez.
3D again.
The broken glass?
Something's got out of the paintings?
Doctor, what is it?
Doctor!
Yeah, it's me, we can hear you. Where are you?
Who are you talking to?
Nothing here.
I think there's three of them now.
Why am I the witch?
Hello?
What...he said.
Right. Prattling mortals, off you pop, or I'll turn you all into frogs.
Doctor, what's going on?
Where are we going?
Lock and key - bit basic, isn't it?
But you let me in?
Sorry, my what?
What is that?
Why not?
OK, so this is how we're going to rescue the Doctor.
Erm, Kate. Should they be here? Why have they followed us?
The humans...?
Activation code, right?
It wasn't locked.
So they're both you, then, yeah?
A bit. Nice suit!
Hang on. Three of you in one cell, and none of you thought to try the door?
So they want this one?
That's him! That's the Zygon in the picture now.
And now the world is worth conquering. So the Zygons are invading the future from the past.
Zygons?
And you actually killed one of them?
No, UNIT HQ, they followed us there in the Black Archive.
OK...so you've heard of that, then.
How can they do that?
Also the showing off.
Hello.
I'm Clara. We haven't really met yet.
The Doctor - my... my Doctor - he's always talking about the day he did it, the day he wiped out the Time Lords to stop the war...
You wouldn't. Because you haven't done it yet. It's still in your future.
He regrets it. I see it in his eyes every day. He'd do anything to change it.
Your eyes. You're so much younger.
Who's there? Who were you talking to...?
I told you - he hasn't done it yet.
Nothing...
You told me you wiped out your own people. I just... I never pictured you doing it, that's all.
What's happening?
These are the people you're going to burn?
Look at you... the three of you. The warrior. The hero. And you.
Have you really forgotten?
We've got enough warriors - any old idiot can be hero.
What you've always done. Be a doctor! You told me the name you chose was a promise. What was the promise?
What? What don't they know?
So what are we doing? What's the plan?
Tiny bit of an ask.
But where would Gallifrey be?
Life and soul, you are
That's right - aim high!
Mm! On it!
Need a moment alone with your painting?
Those big, sad eyes.
I always know.  Oh, by the way, there was an old man looking for you. I think it was the curator.
Danny Pink... is dead.
Stop! You can't kill me.
I'm a target of strategic value. Alive, I'm a tactical advantage. Dead, I'm your biggest mistake. You don't know who I am.
Incorrect. You see,  is what you're supposed to think.  is what everybody thinks.
Clara Oswald is a cover story, a disguise. There is  Clara Oswald.
Oh, don't be so slow, it's embarrassing. Who could fool you like this? Who could hide right under your nose? Who could change their face any time they want? Hmm. You see, I'm not Clara Oswald. Clara Oswald has never existed.
I'm the Doctor.
Well, gentlemen. Where to start? I was born on the planet Gallifrey, in the constellation of Kasterborous. I'm a Time Lord, but my Prydonian privileges were revoked when I stole a time capsule and ran away. Currently pilot a Type 40 TARDIS. I've been married four times, all deceased. My children and grandchildren are missing, and I assume, dead. I have a non-Gallifreyan daughter created via genetic transfer. How much more do you need? I'm the Doctor.
How about my name?
Well, my name isn't Doctor, is it? I don't even really have a doctorate. Well, Glasgow University, but then I accidentally graduated in the wrong century, so technically...
Ah, no. I'm not!
Oh, seriously, this is getting old. Look, there is no Clara Oswald. I invented her. I made her up.
Yeah, I chose that date. Always liked it.
Stories. Stories. Stories. I made them up. Look, ask anybody who knows me. I am an incredible liar.
Hello? Hello?
Are you the one that brought me here?
So you know who I am, right?
Of course I'm not the Doctor. I was lying to stay alive. But how do I know so much about him?
No, I'm not. I'm not his associate. I'm his best friend. Right now, his best friend, anywhere in the universe. Have you got any sort of Cyber-Internet in there because, really, you should look it up. Look up what happens to you if you harm me.
What, you think I would give up the Doctor? Don't be daft. I would never, ever, give up the Doctor, because he is my best friend, too. He is the closest person to me in this whole world. He is the man I will always forgive, always trust. The one man I would never, ever lie to.
Danny?
Oh, my God. Danny...
Danny, I am so sorry.
What is that?
What does it inhibit?
The woman in the shop wrote it down. It's a helpline, isn't it?
The woman. The woman in the shop.
Doctor. With Danny.
Not quite. But he wants to be.
He's a Cyberman.
And he's crying. Doctor, he feels it. He's crying.
It's in his chest. He says it's an inhibitor. It can delete emotion or something.
He's already a Cyberman.
He's hurting because I hurt him and he wants it to stop.
Look, are you going to help me, because I can't do this alone.
Look, the TARDIS can home in on this call, right? Either you help me, or you leave me alone.
There's a lot of switches round the edge. I'm just going to try pressing them all.
I am so sorry.
Two more to go. Does it feel any different?
Are you sure?
Help me.
No.
Give me the screwdriver.
Just do it, Doctor. Do as you are told.
Just point and think, yeah?
OK. I wasn't very good at it, but I did love you.
I'm never going to say that again.
Ready?
I feel like I'm killing you.
Goodbye, Danny.
Well. The clouds have all gone.
Doctor, I'm assuming you'll remember those coordinates?
Old friend, is she? If you have ever let this creature live, everything that happened today, is on you. All of it, on you. And you're not going to let her live again.
Really?
Doctor!
She is.
Doctor, she's talking about her dad.
Danny? Danny? Is that you?
Please say it's you.
The Doctor told me about the bracelet, how it can let Missy travel from one world to the other.
Yes, but the bracelet can bring you home.
Then come on. Hurry up!
Danny!
Hey.
Two weeks late.
Improving.
News?
Yeah. Yeah, he did.
Listen, Doctor. There's, there's something that I have to tell you and, er, it's not good news so just, just listen, OK?
Sorry?
You do?
OK, no, that's not exactly...
No, it's  fine. It, it really isn't fine.
Wow! Oh, my God,
So, what are you going to do now?
OK.
What, you?
You won't just steal a TARDIS and run away?
Never again.
Yeah. Me and Danny. Me and Danny, we are going to be fine. Don't you worry. You go home. Go home. Go be a king or something.
Or queen, you know. Whatever.
Yeah.  Tell you what, seeing as it's goodbye, shall we break a habit?
Hug.
Fair enough.
Why don't you like hugging, Doctor?
Yeah.
Doctor? Travelling with you made me feel really special. Thank you for that. Thank you for making me feel special.
Clara!
It is Clara.
Doctor, listen to me. You... you need to calm down.
I think something's gone wrong.
He's not Clara. I'm Clara.
I don't think we are.
What do we do?
Right here. That's him. That's the Doctor.
Doctor, please, you have to lie down.
Because it's a bed-ROOM, it's for sleeping in.
Doctor, please, you have to lie down, you keep passing out.
So what now?
So what do we do? How do we fix him?
How do we change him back?
What have I done wrong?
What's wrong with it?
Where did he get that face? Why's it got lines on it? It's brand-new. How can his hair be all grey? He only just got it.
I know. I do, I...I know that.
It's just...
Nothing.
If... If Vastra changed, if she was different, if she wasn't the person that you liked...
Are you translating?
Who can't see it? I think all of London can see it.
OK, whatever.
Not wearing a coat.
Clothes.
Probably not.
It's hair.
Why are you wearing your veil?
And then we got swallowed by a big dinosaur. You probably noticed.
I don't know, I don't know, we were... crashing about everywhere. The Doctor was gone, the TARDIS went haywire.
OK, he changed.
Renewed, fine.
I'm not smiling.
You said renewed. He doesn't... He doesn't look renewed, he looks... older.
He looked young.
Shut up!
I did not flirt with him.
How?
Me?
What reason?
Are you judging me?
How dare you? How dare you?
Marcus Aurelius, Roman Emperor, last of the five good'uns, stoic philosopher.
And the only pin-up I ever had on my wall when I was 15, the only one I ever had. I am not sure who you think you're talking to right now, Madam Vastra, but I have never had the slightest interest in pretty young men. And for the record, if there ever was anybody who could flirt with a mountain range, she's probably standing in front of you right now! Just because my pretty face has turned your head, do not assume that I am so easily distracted.
When did you stop wearing your veil?
Should we not have told the Doctor?
The Doctor! What's he doing here?
Doctor... I know you're upset, but you need to calm down and talk to us. What is the question?
Do you think that's whoever...?  What he's doing? He'll drown!
Why?
Strax!
You got the TARDIS, then?
OK, that last part?
Yeah, why not?
Jenny!
Morning. Erm, so what are we going to do? Are we looking for the Doctor?
For dinner?
Erm...
Thank you, Strax!
Er, no, thanks. Maybe just some water.
Um...
All of a sudden, I'm not very thirsty.
Ah.
You're looking at my eye.
What? What's interesting?
What are you looking at?
Well, stop looking.
Stop... right there.
They are on!
Why are you doing this?
Ow!  Why would we be serving together? The Doctor's going to come back, isn't he?
He's not just going to abandon me here.
Madame Vastra!
Look!
No, look!  Look.
Of course it's from the Doctor. The Impossible Girl, that's what he calls me!
So what am I supposed to do - guess where we're meeting?
It doesn't makes sense. He doesn't do puzzles. He isn't complicated, really doesn't have the attention span. So...  keeping it dead simple... "..on the other side."
I don't know! Maybe the smell?
Where did you get that coat?
From where?
No.
You don't have any money.
No! That watch was beautiful.
You swapped your favourite watch for that coat - that's maybe not a good deal.
OK.
No, no. Don't, don't... Don't, don't smile. I will smile first and then you know it's safe to smile.
I am not cross, but if I was cross it would be your fault and... yes, I am cross.
I am extremely cross.
I would be cross if I wasn't cross!
Why? An ordinary person wants to meet someone that they know very well for lunch, what do they do?
Mm-hm. OK, so what sort of person would put a cryptic note in…in a newspaper advert?
Oh, go on, do say.
Thank you. Well, at least that hasn't changed.
No, I don't suppose it will either.
No. No... no, I didn't place the ad. You placed the ad.
Yes, you placed the ad, I figured it out! Impossible Girl, see, lunch?
FOR the Impossible... Girl.
Hmm.
Hang on. "Egomaniac, needy, game-player"?
That was me?
Yes, I am minding that!
You were talking about me?
Nothing is more important than my egomania!
You never mention that again!
What are you doing? And that isn't the only grey one, if you are, erm, having a cull.
If I got new hair, and it was grey, I would have a problem.
Meaning?
Ow!
Oooh, are you trying to tell me something?
Right, moments when you know you are boring.
Mmm, basically, don't you always think that?
You just said to look!
They look fine to me. They're just eating.
OK, no. No, they're not eating.
What do we do?
Hmm! Slightly lost my appetite. How long before they notice that we're different?
Anything we can do?
We could just casually stroll out of here, like we've changed our minds.
Ha! Course it does.
We could... take another look at the menu.
What are they?
OK, what is this restaurant?
Mm. Is there a lot of demand for those?
OK. Robot in a mask.
Yeah, it's very convincing.
Oh!
Is it OK if I don't?
This is not a real restaurant, is it?
So, where are we now?
So why hasn't somebody come for us?
We're alive in a larder.
OK.
Go for it.
No.
Next time, make one that doesn't roll.
I can only just about reach.
Who?
Ready?
Oh. Sorry, did I hit... something?
You should make that thing voice-activated. Oh, for God's sake, it is, isn't it?
Doctor?
How do you know?
So... is it these guys that killed the dinosaur?
Why would robots need organs? Burke and Hare from space?
Can he see us?
Hoping?
Are you sure?
OK, so half-man, half-robot. A cyborg, yeah?
Oh?
Oh?
What about them?
I'm looking.
I don't understand.
That's what the restaurant's for.
Aggh!
Is it awake?
Doctor!
Oh, hurry up, get out.
Doctor!
Quickly!
Well, give me the screwdriver!
Doctor?  Oh!
All right, stop. Stop it, all of you, now.
If you don't stop it, I'm going to have each and every single one of you kicked out of this school!
What did you say?
Yeah, I know, or what?
Go on, then. Do it. I'm not going to answer any of your questions, so you have to do it. You have to kill me. Threats don't work unless you deliver.
Nope.
Destroy me, then. And if you don't, then... I not going to believe a single threat you make from now on. Of course, if I'm dead, then... I can't tell you where the other one went, then... You need to keep this place down here a secret, don't you? Never start with your final sanction. You've got nowhere to go but backwards.
Bigger threat to smaller threat - see what I mean? Backwards.
Are you trying to scare me? Well, cos I'm already bloody terrified of dying... and I'll endure a lot of pain for a very long time before I give up the information that's keeping me alive. How long have you got?
All you can offer me is my life - what you can't do is threaten it. You can negotiate.
OK, OK, OK! OK, yes, yes, yes, I'm crying and it's just because I am very frightened of you. If you know anything about human beings, that means you...  you're in a lot trouble.
You don't have a choice. I tell you what, I'll answer your questions if you answer mine.
We'll take turns, I'll go first. Why did you kill the dinosaur?
Why did you kill the dinosaur?
Then you might as well kill me, because I'm not talking again till you do.
You burned a whole dinosaur for a spare part? No, no, hang on. You know what's in a dinosaur's optic nerve, which means you've seen them before.
How long have you been rebuilding yourselves? Look at the state of you! Is there any real you left? What's the point?
The what? The Promised Land? What's that?
I don't know. But I know where he will be...where he will always be. If the Doctor is still the Doctor... he will have my back.  I'm right, aren't I? Go on. Please, please, God, say I'm right.
Yeah, well, I didn't have a lot of time, I'd been suddenly abandoned!
I am not a control freak!
Oh!
What word?
I don't want to say it.
Hang on, she called the police? We never do that, we should start.
He's not a what? This is a slaughterhouse.
Doctor!
Doctor! He's getting away!
OK. Good-o!
Hold your breath! They're stupid. Everybody hold their breath.
I'm not interrupting?
Ah, well, that's exactly what I was going to ask you. Seems like I'm stuck here now. Got a vacancy?
Whose authority?
And who's that?
I just wanted a change of clothes. I don't think I know who the Doctor is any more.
You've redecorated.
I don't like it.
I never thought you were.
Who put that advert in the paper?
The woman. The woman in the shop.
Am I home?
I'm sorry. I'm... I'm so, so sorry... but I don't think I know who you are any more.
Shut up.  I don't have a boyfriend.
Hello! Hello?
Yes, it's you, who's this?
What do you mean, the Doctor?
I don't...
Why? Why would you do this?
Yes.
Yes.
Well, what?
You shouldn't have been listening.
Thank you.
Phoning.
I'm not sure you get a vote.
This isn't my home, by the way.
Where are we?
Ah! You'll fit right in.  Scottish.
Coffee. Coffee would be great. You're buying!
You're fetching, then.
Yeah, still not sure you get a vote.
I told you it'd work!
Oh, admit it. I totally saved your life.
I totally saved you from having to marry that giant sentient plant thing. That bit where I jumped over the side? That was amazing! Hah! I knew you were impressed!
Hello?
Oh. Rigsy. Hey. What's wrong?
Look, look, no matter how bad it is, we cannot take you back down your timeline just to fix a tattoo.
Sorry, what?
Hang tight. We'll be right there.
Hello. Oh, Rigsy, she's gorgeous.
Shh!
What were you doing last night?
What? What is it?
Rigsy, your phone. It's like they've wiped it, but only the last day. No location data, no texts, nothing. You're sure the screen wasn't cracked before yesterday?
What-conned?
He's making an effort to be nice.
Like a trap street, only not.
A trap street. You know, when someone's making a map, a, um... cartographer, uses a fake street, throws it into the mix, names it after one of his kids or whatever. Then if the fake street, the trap street, ever shows up on someone else's map, they know their work's been stolen. Clever, right?
I know! Focus on the buildings directly below me.
Hello, London!
I'm good. I'm good.
So, these are the bits my eyes skated over.
22, 23...
Four, five, six...
One, two, three...
Got ya.
It's off this street, I am certain.
Someone called you. Yesterday, 6am. Blocked number.
Rigsy, what is it?
I see it. You?
Surely people wander in here all the time, then, distracted, on their phones or whatever?
Ashildr!
We met.
OK, that's...slightly odd. But nice. Um, hang on, so this is where you've been. That's why he lost track of you. Oh, come on, please. It's really cute, he thinks I don't know. He's got this whole secret room in the TARDIS where he collects mentions of you.
He lost track of you in the early 1800s. I wondered if you were...
Ashildr? What's going on?
Hang on. You did this to Rigsy?
Sentenced him?
Oh, the hell it will!
Shut up, I can handle myself.
What did you say?
Fascinating. Now, can we skip to the part where you want Rigsy dead for some reason?
How did Rigsy even get in? I mean, we barely managed it...
.. and we knew what we were looking for...
"Seems"? You've sentenced Rigsy to death yet you don't know exactly what's going on?
This is ridiculous, this is...
Is that bad?
I think we saw her son outside.
There is no way you did this.
Yes!
Obviously! Which means one of your pet aliens out there is the real killer.
OK, we split up. Cover more ground. I'm good cop, you're bad cop.
Doctor, we've discussed this. Your face.
Rump? It's, em, Rump, isn't it? That man's wife. She said something. "Give it to me, tell me I can have it." What did she mean?
Give it? You can just...
Ssh! Go on, I've always wanted a tattoo. You know, something small. Discreet.
Weren't you listening? I'm under the Mayor's personal protection. And it's absolute, apparently. Look, she controls the raven, so I will never have to face it. This is clever.
No, this is us talking the opposition into their own trap. This is Doctor 10<a rel="nofollow" class="postlink" href="http://transcripts.foreverdreaming.org/viewtopic.php?f=53&amp;t=23927">1</a>. We're buying time. We get all the aliens on our side in the next half an hour, and then we reveal I've got the chronolock, not you, and boom! We buy ourselves more time to find the real killer.
Doctor 102 - never tell anyone your actual plan. He'll have a tantrum when he finds out. And then, when we confront Ashildr, she'll want to take the chronolock off just to shut him up. What happens if you don't go home tonight to Jen and Lucy, eh? If you never go home? You really want your little girl growing up without a father just because he wouldn't take a risk? You trusted us to save you, so trust us. Come on.
Well, I was kind of hoping that would be it. I say I want it, you say, "You can have it" - done deal. Hey, turn around, let me see.
No, not every day. Sometimes Jane Austen and I prank each other. Oh, she is the worst. I love her. Take that how you like.
There's 12 minutes left. I'm not giving up yet.
The way they look at you?
Hey. Wait. Everyone here is weird around us because of Rigsy. But not you. You look at me and the Doctor like you're confused. Like you're curious.
You do. You know Rigsy is innocent because you can look into his past and you can see it. Can't you?
She dressed you as a boy to protect you, but really you're a girl. You have the gift.
So, look, Ashildr got it wrong. What does it matter? Come on!
The TARDIS? That's what this is about? Doctor, wait!
Doctor!
What?
Take the teleport off him first!
Go on, then. Take it off.
I wasn't sacrificing anything! It was strategy. backup plan, to buy us more time.
Nobody did! I did! Rump said...
He said the death is locked in. You can pass it on, but...
But...
We can fix this. Can't we? We always fix it.
Doctor, for God's sake, will you stop?
I did this, do you hear me? I did this. This was my fault.
Liar. You always care. Always have. Your reign of terror will end with the sight of the first crying child and you know it.
I do. Listen... If this is the last I ever see of you, please... not like this.
Is there anything you can do?
Time's short. Yes or no?
Well, if Danny Pink can do it, so can I.
Die right. Die like I mean it. Face the raven.
Maybe this is what I wanted. Maybe this is it. Maybe this is why I kept running. Maybe this is why I kept taking all those stupid risks. Kept pushing it.
This is my choice.
Why? Why shouldn't I be so reckless? You're reckless all the bloody time! Why can't I be like you?
I never asked you to.
Don't. Shut up.
Really, Rigsy, shut up. If you feel guilty about this, even for one minute, I...
You. Now, you listen to me. You're going to be alone now, and you're very bad at that. You're going to be furious and you're going to be sad, but listen to me. Don't let this change you. No, listen. Whatever happens next... wherever she is sending you, I know what you're capable of. You don't be a warrior. Promise me. Be a Doctor.
Heal yourself. You have to. You can't let this turn you into a monster. So... I'm not asking you for a promise. I'm giving you an order. You will not insult my memory. There will be no revenge. I will die, and no-one else, here or anywhere, will suffer.
If there was something I could do about that, I would. I guess we're both just going to have to be brave.
Everything you are about to say, I already know. Don't do it now. We've already had enough bad timing.
Nah. You stay here. In the end, everybody does this alone.
This is as brave... as I know how to be. I know it's going to hurt you, but...please... be a little proud of me. Goodbye, Doctor.
Let me be brave. Let me be brave...
Oh, no. It's all right. Danny's got a little bit territorial. The idea of me leaving so much as a toothbrush here. But, still, he's all right with us doing this which I admit's a little bit weird, cos you'd think if he had a problem with me leaving stuff in the TARDIS, he'd object to me travelling in the TARDIS. But he's not, so.
Ish? Don't give me an ish.
Er, Doctor?
Bristol? Doctor, we're in Bristol!
No. Not impressive. Annoying.
Yes. I get it. You're excited. When can I go home?
Fine. I'll go take a look around.
That's all right, don't worry. I've heard worse.
Oh, no. I haven't actually
So, er, what's all this about? What's happened to all these people?
Do you think there's a connection?
And where are you?
No, you're not. I'm here and I can't see. Oh.
Oh, my God, that is so adorable. Are you in there?
Yeah, well, I can't help it, can I, with you and your big old face. How are you going to get out?
Aliens?
Please don't do that. That's just wrong.
Oh, wow. This is an honour. Does this mean I'm you now?
Ow! What just happened?
Anything?
I'm the Doctor.
But you can call me Clara.
I think I just picked the title because it makes me sound important.
Yeah, doesn't everyone?
Huh? Oh, sorry. I'm talking to somebody else. He's listening in. Doctor, Rigsy, Rigsy, the Doctor.
Yeah, well, I think he could still be useful.
And all those other missing people, I suppose you know where they lived.
Sorry, what?
OK, right
What if he is still in this room like you said, only tiny? You know, like underneath the sofa or something.
Rigsy! One sec. Doctor, open the doors.
Look, you want him to stay or not?
Rigsy, come here. Meet the Doctor.
So, what do you think? Tiny man idea.
And you didn't think to tell me?
No. Well, he is.
Doctor? Doctor, did you hear that?
OK. Go. Rigsy, this is where we run. Stick with me.
Yes, this case has got our attention.
My shrink ray theory? I thought you were already scanning for that.
Doctor? What are you doing?
What do you mean, they're in the
Apparently they're in the walls.
Oh, well, he's usually out of the box. But, yep.
No. Well, it's kind of a more of a right place, right time or wrong place, wrong time depending on how he's behaving.
PC Forrest? Hello? Hello?
Doctor, she's gone.
Her nervous system.
What? Why?
Doctor. The handle, they've flattened the handle.
I really don't want to find out.
Hey, you.
Just a little. Sorry, Danny. I think lunch is er, a bust.
Er, that's just a guy on community support and I'm helping him find his auntie.
Er, yeah, there was a thing, er a thing.
No, no, no, I'm fine!
Danny?
Oh, not much, just some nonsense. Long story.
Tell you later. Love you!
Yeah? Well, thought it was pretty weak myself.
Well, he is.
Doctor
Well, there you go.
Ah. Doctor, you're breaking up a bit.
No, really, you are. I can't hear you.
Doing it.
Does it even still count as lying if you're doing for someone's own good? Well, like, technically their own good.
What do I do?
They're very realistic. Who painted them?
Or did they just appear after people disappeared?
Health and safety. This subway is unsafe. Everyone needs to leave right now.
What?
Forget Stan. Your friend's gone.
We need to move. Now.
I'm on it. George. George, isn't it? Can you watch that area? If you hear anything, anything moves, you shout, OK?
Seriously?
Fine, I'll tell you who I am. I am the one chance you've got of staying alive. That's who I am.
Rigsy, how well do you know this area? Do you know where that door leads?
Yeah, well, you might be glad he did. Those things come in here, that is our only way out.  I just hope I can keep them all alive.
Lie to them.
Lie to them. Give them hope. Tell them they're all going to be fine. Isn't that what you would do?
Dawdle. End up dead.
Vaguely.
You think this is all one big misunderstanding?
Why can't the TARDIS just translate?
He's got a hunch.
Do you really believe that?
55? What does that mean?
It could be an apology, for all we know?
Shush, shush, shush. Listen. Wait.
Twenty two.
Maybe. Or maybe they're showing us they can read.
George?
The tunnel!
Another flat handle. They were here. Not now. They've stopped chasing us, I think. It feels like they're cornering us.
Rigsy, where's the next exit?
Yeah, not bad. So this thing you're working on?
A de-flattener?
Two D is. Two Dee Iz?
Long way round it is.
The Doctor thinks we might be in trouble. He thinks they might be close.
I don't know. He's not sure. He's getting readings all around.
Doctor? The door.
And it will work this time?
Hang on! Hang on.
Wait.
We're in the bad news!
Do it! Now!
Great. What do you want me to do about it?
Maybe if I ask them really nicely, they'll fill you up again. Hey!
Doctor?
Hello? Doctor? Look, can we please deal with this later? Because we need to move.
No, I mean you move the TARDIS. Like...
Doctor? Doctor?
We should go.
MI5. We've got a, er
Can we ram the blockage? The train's empty, isn't it?
Can we rig it to drive without that? Send it in with no driver?
Rigsy!
Er, what are you doing?
You'll die.
Well, why'd you want to do that?
OK, fine, yeah. And I'll always remember you.
Cos I was just going to do this.
No driver required. And I really like that hair band, but I suppose I'll just take it, will I? And every time I look at it, I'll remember the hero who died to save it. Come on. You're not getting off that lightly. There's work that needs doing.
I quite liked that hair band.
I think it's the TARDIS.
Doctor?
Doctor? What would you do now? No. What will I do now? OK, OK, OK. OK, the last thing the Doctor said was that the TARDIS needed energy. He said if it gets energy, he can beat them.
Yeah, are you?
Come on, Graffiti Boy, I've got a commission for you.
Well, fine, if you don't think you're up to it.
You want to walk? Walk. You want to stay? Then shush!
No. Not into the wall. Through the wall. Rule number one of being the Doctor. Use your enemy's power against them.
They can't restore three dimensions to a door that never existed.
It worked. They charged the TARDIS.
You all right?
Do people still say chipper?
I'm alive.
Yeah, but we saved the world, right?
OK, so, on balance
Yeah, that's how you think, isn't it?
Yeah, well, I was you today. I was the Doctor. And, apparently, I was quite good at it.
Yeah, but the power was going off so I suppose you were delirious. You didn't know what you were saying.
You do realise he can hear you now?
Come here. Admit it. I did well.
Just say it. Why can't you just say it? Why can't you just say I did good?
It's not him. Come on, why can't you say it? I was the Doctor and I was good.
Thank you.
Doctor... you are not the only person who ever lost someone. It's the story of everybody. Get over it. Beat it. Break free.
Doctor, it's time. Get up, off your arse... and win!
Let me be brave.
Let me be brave...
Doctor?
Where am I? Is this the TARDIS?
What planet?
I was about to die. I should be dead.
Hang on, your place?
What do you mean, your place?
You don't mean...?
Gallifrey...
OK. Er... Hang on. Wait. What? What? Did I miss something?
Who's he?
Oh... Oh, that's weird. What's wrong with my ears?
Oh, it's weird. Everything sounds wrong.
I can hear you. I can hear you fine. It's like... I don't know, it's like, erm... It's like something's missing.
Tell me what? What's he talking about? Doctor...? Doctor, what's going on?
What sound? What's wrong? Just tell me. Doctor, what sound?
If I'm frozen, how can I... How can I be walking about?
Yes, it matters to me!
Doctor, what is going on?
Doctor...?
Doctor, will you just talk to me!
My jaw?
Doctor... Please... I don't want this. Put it down, please.
You killed that man! You shot him! He's dead!
I don't care!
So does he!
I thought you said Gallifrey was frozen in another dimension?
How?
No. Tell me what a neural block is.
What did you mean, human compatible?
Why?
How long are we planning to stay?
You realise how well that conversation went, right?
Is it trapped?
And?
What's to defend in a crypt?
Database? What do you mean, database?
Oh?
Oh? Oh...
Oh.
Was I supposed to understand any of that?
Didn't hurt, did it?
Why would a computer need to protect itself from the people who made it?
What, and the kid told you the secret?
OK, that's encouraging...
Was she, erm... Was she nice, the President's wife?
I'd know you anywhere.
Look at me again.
In the eye. Look at me. Just do it.
How long has it been for you since you last saw me?
How long?
They what? Who? Who are we talking about?
What happened to your coat? The velvety coat. I liked that one, it was... it was very Doctory.
Why?
Tell me what they did to you. Tell me, what happened to the Doctor?
How much time?
Stay back.
I said, stay back!  The Hybrid, what is it? What's so important you would fight so long?
What were you bargaining for?
How long?
One question. And you will answer. How long was the Doctor trapped inside the confession dial?
Four-and-a-half-billion years...
Why would you even do that? I was dead! I was dead and gone. Why? Why would you even do that to yourself?
OK, listen... I have something I need to say.
No, my time. My time is up. Doctor, between one heartbeat and the last is all the time I have. People like me and you, we should say things to one another. And I'm going to say them now...
You're monsters. Here you are, hiding away at the end of time. Do you even know why? Because you are hated. You are... hated by everybody. But by nobody more than me.
Oh, nothing I'm going to tell you, or anybody else. Except, maybe this one part. I said...  "Don't worry, Doctor. They'll all be looking at me!"
You really are thick, aren't you? The Doctor is back on Gallifrey. Took him four-and-half-billion years to get here. What do you think he's going to do now?
Why, he's stealing a TARDIS and running away. Bye!
You were quick.
Boy?
Basic.
It's all white.
Yeah?
Doctor... I still don't have a pulse.
I know how to take my pulse. Look, I know how to do it. See, no pulse, right? Is it still there? Don't lie to me.
They said, your lot, that if you saved me, time would fracture. What does that mean?
Always?
No. Not when you're shouting. Where are we going?
To what?
A neural block. Human compatible. That's what you said.
I am checking it properly!
What if one last heartbeat is all I've got? What if time isn't healing? What if the universe needs me to die?
How can there be anybody there?
What's out there?
Screen on.
Missy...!
Screen off.
Yeah. Yeah, yeah. Just, you know, my pulse.
Yeah, sure.
I was watching. On the monitor. No. Doctor, whatever you're about to do, don't do it!
And then?
But...
Just say it. Say it. Come on. Tell me.
And why would I want that?
I, er... I used these.
That.
What do you think? Ashildr's right, you see? We're too alike.
What else? What else do you think I did? I reversed the polarity. Push that button, Doctor, it will go off in your own face.
What were you doing to me?
Why? Nobody's ever safe. I've never asked you for that, ever. These have been the best years of my life. And they are mine. Tomorrow is promised to no-one, Doctor, but I insist upon my past. I am entitled to that. It's mine.
So what happens now? Hey? Me and you, what do we do now?
Doctor...?
You really don't know which?
How about we just don't? Why don't we just... fly away somewhere?
God, yeah.
Good luck, Doctor.
So, what happens now?
And one of us... One of us will... I don't think I could ever forget you.
No...
What?
No. Stop it. You're saying goodbye. Don't say goodbye!
Stop it! Stop! Stop it!
I didn't mean to do this. I'm sorry.
I can't. There has to be something I can do.
How could I smile?
Awesome.
Time isn't healing. I am still frozen.
It means my death is a fixed event. The universe depends on it happening.
Why? Why does everybody think I am so scared? We all face the raven in the end. That is the deal. If I go back to Gallifrey, they can put me back, right? On Trap Street, the moment they took me out?
Mind you... seeing as I'm not actually ageing, there's a tiny little bit of wiggle room, isn't there?
Wiggle room. Yeah, you know, wiggle room. We could, erm, you know, stop off on the way.
Gallifrey. Like I said... Gallifrey. The long way round.
Hi. What can I get you?
OK. Don't you need to plug that thing in?
You're not.
Magic. Or... maybe I went to an airport and caught a plane.
You?
I believe you. You been travelling?
Is it a sad song?
What's it called?
Tell me about her.
Oh, you like a cliffhanger, don't you? So you went back to your home town...
Glasgow?
And there was this gang boss and he wanted to kill you.
Is this a story or did this really happen?
This Clara person, you must really like her.
You killed a man. You don't seem the type.
So what was it, the thing you took?
Of what?
Are you looking for her?
She could be anyone, right? You don't know who you're looking for. I mean, she could be me, for all you know.
What about your TARDIS, hey? Have you found that yet?
Well, maybe someone will find your TARDIS for you.
What Clara told you in the Cloisters...
You said memories... become stories when we forget them. Maybe some of them become songs.
Yeah, it would be, wouldn't it?
Ghostbusters!
Getting that. Bless you, though.
This is actually your house?
Sorry. You went to the bank and said, &quot;You know that gigantic old haunted house on the moors? The one the dossers are too scared to doss in? The one the birds are too scared to fly over?&quot; And then you said, &quot;I'd like to buy it, please, with my money.&quot;
That's incredibly brave.
So what's an empathic psychic?
Doctor?
Shh.
Is she real? As in, actually real?
She never changes. The angle's different, the framing, but she's always in exactly the same position. Why is that?
What's she saying?
Where?
Why would I want to do that?
Well, I dispute that assertion.
Fine.  Dare me.
Say we actually find her. What do we say?
Why?
Carlisle.
No.
Do you feel like you're being watched?
That's the chap.
I think she's here.
Doctor? Doctor!
I'm not happy.
Hey!
What was that?
OK, what is that?
But what's making it?!
Doctor?
I may be a teeny, tiny bit terrified.
But I'm still a grown-up.
There's no need to actually hold my hand.
Yes?
Doctor?!
Doctor.
Me too.  Whisky's the 11th most disgusting thing ever invented.
So, you and Professor Palmer, have you ever... y'know?
Why not?  You do know how he feels about you, don't you? You of all people?
Oh, this is there.
Because it's obvious. It sticks out like a... big chin.
Oh, I don't think so.
Sorry?
I've got this weird feeling it's looking at me. It doesn't like me.
Hey!  You need a place to keep this.
Sorry.
So... where we going?
So, when are we going?
And the answer is...?
&quot;We're going always.&quot;
That's not actually a sentence.
Colour's a bit boisterous.
Makes my eyes hurt.
When are we?
Totally. Peachy keen.
No, it's not that. Have we just watched the entire life cycle of the Earth? Birth to death?
And you're OK with that?
How can you be?
That's not what I mean.
I mean, one minute you're in 1974, looking for ghosts but all you have to do is open your eyes and talk to whoever's standing there. To you, I haven't been born yet... and to you, I've been dead 100 billion years. Is my body out there somewhere? In the ground?
But here we are, talking. So I am a ghost. To you, I'm a ghost... we're all ghosts to you. We must be nothing.
Then what are we? What can we possibly be?
I just saw something I wish I hadn't.
That... everything ends.
But what's she running from?
What is that?
Can't you just... y'know?
Fly the TARDIS into the parallel universe?
What is that?
I don't...
Doctor!
Just a few more seconds!
No!
Wake up!  WAKE UP!  Open the thing!
Wasn't enough, she needs to do it again.
She HAS to!
We can't leave him.
Oh, come ON! Let me in, you grumpy old cow!
Whoa!
What's this now?
Oh, you are a cow. I knew it! Whatever. You have to help the Doctor.
You can enter the pocket universe.
You're talking but all I hear is, &quot;Meh, meh, meh.&quot; Come on, let's go!  Hey, hey, hey!
Oh, come ON!
Ah! Whoa! WAH!
'Wah!'
Oh, oh! Whoa!
Woo-hoo! Woo!
Woo-hoo!
Woo!
Hi.
Doctor!
I'm not happy.
Doctor?
Carefully?
Sharks don't actually smile. They're just... Well, they've got lots and lots of teeth - they're quite eaty.
There's two of them?!
Ha-ha! Woo!
Ah!
'Woo!'
Because it was alive so long.
Must have been a good year to be a tree.
You're always showing me amazing things. Well, I, Doctor, have finally got something amazing to show you.
You're going to love this.
Huh? What child?
She probably has a name.
What? Maebh?
Brand new forest?
Is that the forest that's covering London?
Look, is she all right? Will you bring her over?
All we've got are Oyster cards.
Who?
Oh, yeah. Rang school and parents. Yes, of course. Thought that was the priority.
And I couldn't get through. Left messages. I'll try again.
No, he called me, actually. I can't stop him calling me, can I?
London has just been taken over by a gigantic forest. Who do you want to talk to, Monty Don?
Oh, really? How many kids?
Where's Maebh Arden?
She's with the Doctor.
He didn't abduct her. She was lost. He found her.
The question is, how did they get here? Can a forest grow overnight, or have we been asleep for years, like Sleeping Beauty?
Oh, absolutely. Yeah. That is the big question.
You are enjoying this just a little bit too much. Come on. Are you not even a little bit curious about how? Who? Why? When?
You see, now, that attitude is  actually very attractive.
Oh, Ruby, this really isn't the right moment
Right, Ruby.
Oh, yeah. That is strange.
Ah ha! There it is. All sorted now. Come on.
I cannot believe Bradley just said please.
Yeah. He usually prefers other means of persuasion.
You could try saying please, Bradley.
And Ruby...
You bring out the best in them.
Everyone, this is the Doctor, and he's going to sort everything out. Isn't that right, Doctor? It's what he does.
He always says that. He's really clever.
Don't worry. It's a thing he does. He pretends he's not interested and then he has an idea. He's playing for time.
See? Clever kicking in.
So you're saying it's an act of aggression?
Exactly. Well done, Ruby. Someone or something who's trying to scrub the atmosphere before colonising or invading. Ah, yes, Doctor. Ahem. This is Coal Hill Year Eight Gifted and Talented Group.
Ruby, that's enough! Doctor?
Yes, I know that we have to find her. Doctor, listen to me. Her sister went missing last year. She's on medication. The child is barely functioning. She hears voices. She's very vulnerable.
I don't know. She takes tablets and they stop.
Not everything can be fixed with a screwdriver. It's not a magic wand.
Well, yes, she does.
Er, yep.
Oh, I can go. You can...
Something like that.
See? Someone needs to go. Child protection.
Furious, fearful, tongue-tied. They're all superpowers if you use them properly. Are they going to be all right?
What?
Doctor? Look behind us. The path we just walked down. It's overgrown already.
Why would she put her phone down?
I'm actually frightened. I never get frightened. Why am I frightened?
Yes, that is a worry, but I know you'll find her. No, no, no. This is not a worry, this is a dread. Maebh!
Any minute now we're going to find a gingerbread cottage with a cannibal witch inside. Maebh!
Yes. Clever girl.
We're looking for a little girl.
What do they want?
What do you mean, why now?
Well, what else?
What is it?
This is Maebh's. Where did you get this?
Oh, great, right, well, that's just brilliant, isn't it. You don't think Danny saw this, do you?
I always make them date their homework.
Well, there must be a way?
OK, you know they're not really gifted and talented, don't you? I just tell them that to make them feel good.
Was that a howl?
Was that a wolf? No. That is impossible. We're in London.
There is no path.
Maebh?
Maebh! Doctor, give me a boost so I can pull her over. Maebh? Maebh!
Doctor...
Yes. Can we please deal with the wolves first?
Doctor!
What are wolves frightened of?
Mister Pink! Why, thank you very much.
Well done. And for saving us from a tiger, too.
Oh. No, I...
Maebh, can you see something that we can't see?
This really is going to happen, isn't it?
Why would trees want to kill us? We love trees.
But we saw the future. Lots of futures. Earth's futures.
If you can't save them all, save who you can. The TARDIS. It's a lifeboat, isn't it? Not everybody has to die.
When they're done, you need to get in your box and go.
Taking them where? What are you going do with them? Leave them on an asteroid? Find a space academy for the gifted and talented? They just want their mums and dads, and they're never going to stop wanting them.
Danny Pink will never leave those kids so long as he is breathing.
I don't want you to.
Of course I want to live. I just...
Don't make me say it.
I don't want to be the last of my kind.
Because it's the only way to get you back to the TARDIS, make you think you're saving someone. Well, you know what, Doctor? This time, the human race is saving you.
Make it worthwhile.
And on behalf of this world, you're very welcome. Now, go. Save the next one.
Hard to get rid of a flame-proof forest, Maebh, eh? Come on.
Home. He's going home. Which is exactly where we're going.
Yes. Let him call. This is more important.
I thought it would spoil an otherwise enjoyable walk.
The wide ring. The red ring. In the museum, Ruby saw a cross-section of a tree. One of the rings was wider than the others, and red.
Or you think you need to save the world when it's already saving itself.
So, trip to space, anyone?
Tell them, Mister Pink, what an educational opportunity...
What? Coronal ejections, geomagnetic storms. How often do you get a playlist like that?
Really? What person is that, then?
We could have a picnic.
Oh. Well, no, no, no. That was, er, from ages ago. You see, what happened was...
Yeah, they do, don't they?
I tried. He interrupted.
OK. Well...
Yes, you did. And yes, you do.
What?
That is amazing. How will they explain this tomorrow?
We are not going to forget an overnight forest.
Fine, I'll take that class and then, they can do some of the test.
Hey.
You too.
Er, was it you that I saw outside doing the soldiery thing?
What, teaching them how to shoot people?
Ah, you shoot people then cry about it afterwards?
Something wrong?
Sorry?
No, no, no. As far as I know, nobody has told anybody anything. What are you talking about?
I was being funny.
I just do that.
I don't know.
Okay, see you.
Er, are you going to the, er, leaving thing tonight for Cathy?
Oh, okay, never mind.
Change your mind.
I'm going. Er, I'll give you a lift. Why not?
Ah, okay. Maybe some other time, then?
Ahem. [THUDS STOP] Is the wooden sound you or or the desk?
Longer than you would like.
Are you going to look that terrified when you take me out for a drink?
Play your cards right and you might. [SHE LAUGHS]
Where the hell have you been?
Three weeks ago. In Glasgow.
In Glasgow. That's dead in a ditch.
By what?
Was I? No, I wasn't.
Honest?
Yes, I am.
I do look it.
Okay. Right, what is it? What's
You're scared.
Of what?
I don't know.
Er, hey, no offence, but I've got plans.
Right. Where are we going?
A good Dalek?
That's a bit inflexible. Not like you. I'd almost say prejudiced.
You're not my boss, you're one of my hobbies.
I'm his carer.
Will you?
So, what do we do with a moral Dalek, then?
Mmm. How do you get into a Dalek's head?
Why wouldn't I?
I am a school teacher. Still didn't catch your name.
Blue?
No. Er, I just met a soldier called Pink.
Lucky?
So, er, who makes you smile or is nobody up to the job?
Why?
It explodes.
Whoa. Ha. I can't believe this.
That was weird.
What are the lights?
Beautiful.
Oh, my God.
It's amazing.
So how big is it, that living part, compared to me and you, right now?
Yeah.
Oh, God.
Antibodies?
But the Dalek wants us in here. Why is it attacking?
Can you?
Oh, my God. What's it doing?
What did you give him?
Run!
Why?
He'll get us out of here. The difficult part is not killing him before he can.
Also, there's the puns.
Any remarks about my hips will not be appreciated.
(quietly) Thanks.
Okay, that's good. Is that good?
It's incredible.
That's it? Just like that?
Do I see what?
It's the look you get when I'm about to slap you.
Are we going to die in here? I mean, there's a little bit of you that's pleased. The Daleks are evil after all. Everything makes sense. The Doctor is right.
No, Doctor, that is not what we just learned.
One question.
Why did we come here today? What was the point? You. You thought there was a good Dalek. What difference would one good Dalek make?
Is that a fact? Is that really what we've learned today? Think about it. Is that what we've learned?
You couldn't afford me.
Top of the class.
The evil engineering?
Me?
How?
Hand on my heart? Most days he's both.
They're coming. They're coming.
Er, a clever thing, quickly. Think, think, think, think, think. Some of the lights are out.
But it's not damaged, look at them.
So, the Doctor said this was a memory bank and some of the memories were suppressed. What if. What if the dark spots are hidden memories? What if one of those is the Dalek seeing a star?
Yeah. Well, maybe. It's either that or the bulbs need changing.
Got a better idea?
Yep, me too. Ah-ha.
Watch out for antibodies. Let's see if there's an on switch.
What about you, Rusty?
I think that was it. Yep, that was it. Sorry, got to run.
How do I look?
I meant my clothes. I just changed.
When will I see you again?
I don't know.
You asked me if you're a good man and the answer is, I don't know. But I think you try to be and I think that's probably the point.
I think I'd better be.
Hey, Danny.
Yes. Yes, I, I have. Well noticed.
Yes, good. Very good. Good work. You passed the test.
Yeah, course I am. Why wouldn't I?
Thought what?
No. No, not at all.
Not me.
I know what I said. I was the one who said it.
I was tired. Overwrought. I didn't mean it. It's an appliance. It does a job.
You're not getting me to talk to your ship. That's properly bonkers.
You're like one of those guys who can't go out with a girl unless his mother approves.
Now you're creeping me out.
Basic! ‘Cos I'm a girl?
What have I done?
Doctor?
I swear I just touched it.
Please tell me there's a button you can press to fix this.
You're lying.
To stop me freaking out?
Not so much.
Doctor?  Doctor?
Red flashing light...means something bad. Get out of here fast? Or possibly, whatever you do, don't open this door.
Bad decision.
Now that's just showing off.
So that's who...
Oh, thank you.  Thank you. Thank you, thank you, thank you!  Ah! Mwah!  No! The door?  Where's the door gone now? You can't do this!
Why are you doing this?
Who are you?
What do you keep in here?! Why have you got zombie creatures? Good guys do not have zombie creatures. Rule one.  Basic storytelling.
Who are they?
Something you want to share with the rest of us?
So now would be a good time to use that big friendly button, right?
Shush! Something's in here.
Doctor, what are they? What aren't you telling me?
Doctor?  Doctor? Again!
Oh, thank God. Doctor, what's going on?  Say something.
Leaking what?
What about this?
She?
What's that noise?
So? So? So what?
And start to warp.
No. You don't say it. Don't you dare say it.
Run?
Yeah.
You made it through.
Where are we?
Um...what happens if we stay longer?
I always feel so good after we've spoken.
That will not be a problem.
Stop!
You're going to tell me now! If we're going to die in here, tell me what they are.
Tell me! What's the use in secrets now?
We're not safe!
That's me.
It's me. I burn in here.
What do you mean, again?
We're outside.
There's no way across.
So what do we do? Time for a plan. Do you have a plan?
If you don't have a plan, we're dead!
Tell you what?
You know who I am.
Doctor, you invited me - you said...
She really wasn't.
You're scaring me.
I don't know what you're talking about.
I think I'm more scared of you right now than anything else on that TARDIS.
OK. I don't know what the hell this is about, but the hug is really nice.
What?
You're insane.
How can you be so sure?
OK, well, that's watertight.
We're not dead.
So... so it's safe?
What are you going to do?
It's going to hurt?
Wait! All those things you said. How we've met before. How I died...
I don't want to forget. Not all of it. The library. I saw it. You were mentioned in a book.
You call yourself Doctor.  Why do you do that? You have a name. I've seen it. In one corner of that tiny...
You'll still have secrets.
Please tell me there's a button you can press to fix this.
You're lying.
To stop me freaking out?
Not so much.
I feel exhausted. I feel...
Why would you say that?
Of course.
You're being weird.
Of?
That's what I'm counting on. Push the button.
Hello! Hello! Hello, Earth. We have a terrible decision to make. It's an uncertain decision, and we don't have a lot of time. The man... who normally helps, he's gone. Maybe he's not coming back. In fact, I... I really don't think he is. We're on our own. So... an innocent life versus the future of all mankind. We have 45 minutes to decide.
Courtney Woods. Doctor, she has gone crazy. She's uncontrollable. She took your psychic paper. She's been using it as fake ID.
No, to buy White Lightning or alcopops or whatever.
She's one of my year tens. She was in the TARDIS.
Throwing up.
Look, she says that you told her that she wasn't special.
She says that's what sent her off the rails.
Doctor. I know, I know! But, you say something like that to somebody, it hurts. Especially if you're somebody of her age, especially if you're you. Doctor, it can affect her whole life.
Doctor!
Look, Courtney, you're not going to be needing those because you're not going to be doing any travelling. Doctor, will you just, just tell her?
Tell her that she's special.
Hey, Doctor!
What are they?
Why didn't you just tell her you didn't mean it?
Doctor, what are you doing?
Doctor, it goes up and down.
Ah.
Do you know what's wrong with the moon?
Cobwebs?
Courtney!
Oh, my God. Doctor, tell me there wasn't anyone inside that thing.
Come on. Now, Courtney, come here. Don't look. You all right?
Hey. Look. Look at me. Look. It's all right if you're not.
Oh?
Meaning?
Here! Here! The door's locked.
Doctor.
Quick, it's shutting.
Courtney! Courtney!
Courtney! The power's gone again.
Courtney.
You all right?
Doctor
OK.
Doctor, this is dangerous now.
Look, I have a duty of care, OK? You know what that is?
Why are you shutting her in? We don't need to stay, do we?
It's obvious, isn't it? The moon doesn't break up.
Because I've been in the future, and the moon is still there. I think. You know the moon is still there, right?
But you would know.
If the moon fell to bits in 2049, somebody would've mentioned it. It would have come up in conversation. So it doesn't break up. So the world doesn't end. So, let's just get in the TARDIS and go.
Yeah.
How can the moon die, though?
Is it those germ things, then? Are they like cockroaches? Is it, is it an infestation?
Doctor!
Sunlight.
If they're germs. My nan says it's the best disinfectant there is.
What? No. Doctor. Doctor!
Doctor!
If he says so, I suppose he will.
No! Courtney, don't put any photos on Tumblr.
Was that where we landed?  It looks so different.
Courtney! Doctor!
Doctor!
Where's the TARDIS?
Last time you said that, she turned up on the wrong side of the planet.
Look, we need to know where Courtney is.
No, no, no. Of course I don't have her phone number.
I can't. The secretary hates me. She thinks I gave her a packet of TENA Lady for Secret Santa. Look. Courtney's posting stuff on Tumblr. Doesn't that know where you are?
Are you OK?
OK,.do you want to share it with the class?
Growing?
What?
Huh?
Has it, er, has it always been an egg?
OK. So the moon has never been the moon?
Doctor, what is it?
Why'd you want to kill it?
Doctor, wait
Stop. Right, listen. This is a, this is a life. I mean, this must be the biggest life in the universe.
You cannot blame a baby for kicking.
Courtney, you'll be safer where you are.
So what do we do? Doctor? Huh? Doctor, what do we do?
What?
Of course you can help.
Come on. Hey.
Yeah, well, I can't make it.
Well, yeah. A school teacher and an astronaut.
I don't know! The President of America.
I am asking you for help.
OK, don't you do this to make some kind of point.
And you're just going to stand there?
Doctor?
Doctor. Doctor? Doctor!
If we let it live, what would happen if the moon wasn't there?
We're discussing it! What would happen if the moon wasn't there?
OK, there would be no tides. But we'd survive that, right? They've knocked out the satellites. There's no internet, no mobiles. I'd be fine with that.
But the moon isn't make of rock and stone, is it? It's made of eggshell.
I'm going to have to be a lot more certain than that if I'm going to kill a baby.
Well, yeah.
Shush!
And if he doesn't come back?
Hey, why don't you call me Clara?
I think he really might just be leaving it to us.
Can we broadcast on this?
School trip. Can we broadcast on this?
Hello, Earth. We have a terrible decision to make. It's an uncertain decision and we don't have a lot of time.  We can kill this creature or we can let it live. We don't know what it's going to do, we don't know what's going to happen when it hatches. If it will hurt us, help us, or just leave us alone. We have to decide together. This is the last time we'll be able to speak to you, but you can send us a message. If you think we should kill the creature, turn your lights off. If you think we should take the chance, let it live, leave your lights on. We'll be able to see. Goodnight, Earth.
Was that OK?
Come on. Let's see.
Oh, Doctor, where have you gone?
OK.
Did you know?
Yeah, you're right. It's none of your business. Come on, Courtney, off you go. Double Geography.
Go. Go, go. Chop chop.
Tell me what you knew.
Yeah. I noticed. Tell me what you knew, Doctor, or else I'll smack you so hard you'll regenerate.
Honestly, do you have music playing in your head when you say rubbish like that?
Well, why did you do it? Was it for Courtney, was that it?
Do you know what? Shut up! I am so sick of listening to you!
I don't know. I don't know. If you didn't do it for her, I mean. Do you know what? It was, it was cheap, it was pathetic. No, no, no. It was patronising. That was you patting us on the back, saying, you're big enough to go to the shops by yourself now. Go on, toddle along.
Oh, my God, really? Was it? Yeah, well, respected is not how I feel.
I nearly didn't press that button. I nearly got it wrong. That was you, my friend, making me scared. Making me feel like a bloody idiot.
Oh, don't you ever tell me to mind my language. Don't you ever tell me to take the stabilisers off my bike. And don't you dare lump me in with the rest of all the little humans that you think are so tiny and silly and predictable. You walk our Earth, Doctor, you breathe our air. You make us your friend, and that is your moon too. And you can damn well help us when we need it.
What, by clearing off?
Yeah, well, clear off! Go on. You can clear off. Get back in your lonely, your lonely bloody TARDIS and you don't come back.
You go away. OK? You go a long way away.
Hey. Now then.
The usual.
Well, he was wrong, wasn't he? Wasn't he? Danny, what do you think?
No, you haven't. This is new for me.
What did you do?
You loved the army.
I'm done, I'm done. I am finished with it. I am, I am, I'm done. It's over. I'm finished with him, and I told him that. What is that face for? Why don't you believe me?
When did you get to become so wise?
Hello.
Are you Santa Claus?
OK. No. Hang on. Stop. Shut up. What? Seriously, you, you're Father Christmas. You're real.
Well, I thought it was my mum and...
Because you're a fairy tale. I grew out of fairy tales.
I'm really back here. This is, this is real, yeah?
Doctor? Talk to me. I never thought I was going to see you again. What is going on out there? What's happening?
Oh, that noise. Never knew how much I loved it.
Do you know what? Yeah. Right now, here, I think I do.
Doctor?
What are they?
What does that even mean?
They're still coming, aren't they?
How?
Why is she singing?
Sorry, what?
Five hundred and seven.
One thousand nine hundred and seventy two.
I can't help it!
Danny Pink is dead.
He's dead.
OK, Doctor, are you going to explain? What is going on?
An invasion of, of what, elves?
Is it dead?
Meaning we can't trust anything that we see or hear.
So we don't know what is real and what isn't?
Are we in danger?
What you said about Danny. Unacceptable.
Random?
Well, I lied. I lied, so you'd go home to Gallifrey instead of fussing about me.
So we're dying, then?
Why?
How long do we have?
Just. Doctor, give me something to do.
In case it's a lie.
And it wakes up when you think about it?
Only now?
Maybe I could fetch you a cup of tea while I'm at it.
My very next suggestion.
Doctor?
One hundred minus forty two is three hundred and fifty eight times three is one thousand seven hundred and seventy four minus thirty two is one hundred and forty two divided by seven is twenty and, and, and a bit. Think about something else. Think about something else. Danny Pink, Danny, Danny. Danny Pink, I love you. And I'll never see you again, and I'm sorry. I'm sorry I lied. I am sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry...
Who are you?
Danny?
Come on where?
Why?
What day is it?
Is that a thing?
Oh. Well, you've made me want chocolate now.
Tickets for the Indian Orient Express. That painting we saw in Paris, and permission to own a cat.
Because those are exactly the things I want, and you are too clever ever to be wrong.
I always protect your ego from the truth.
It's Christmas.
Danny? Whose blackboard is that?
Yeah, just a moment!
Coming!
Yeah. Just a minute.
Your pyjamas. You're too shy to wear less than two layers.
Yeah, I don't really have to.
Going by the timing, I'd say so.
If you let him anywhere near the subject of golf, I will do a thing, and it will not be a good thing.
And I'm prepared to use them.  Hmmm.
Hi. Doctor?
Merry Christmas.
You remember Danny, of course.
Just stop it.
If this is a dream, how can you be here? How can we both be having the same dream?
And what was that?
You just wake up. Just leave me here, please.
All day.
I miss you.
What?
Don't you soldier me.
When I wake up, you won't be there.
No.
There doesn't seem to be a wound.
OK, so why do we all have that pain?
Don't treat me like a beginner. I was dreaming, then I woke up. I know that.
Fifty seven.
Twenty four.
Doctor, behave.
Can I put it another way? Why would the part of our brain that is trying to keep all of us alive choose you for a face?
Tough.
Shona, take his hand.
It's not like the last time.
Argh.
Doctor!
Sorry, I'll just go and...
Er, what about the Dream Crabs?
And the people that they're eating?
Doctor, the others are still in danger.
We know Dream Crabs are still on Earth.
Doctor? If Santa was only in the dream, why was he on my roof?
What?
Of course they are.
OK, why are they all giving the same answer, because that is a tiny bit freaky.
It's a long story.
Doctor?
Twelve.
Doctor? What are they doing?
How?
But how?
Doctor, it's not the real TARDIS.
It's us.
So what happens now?
This is us just waking up, right?
Or?
I've always believed in Santa Claus. But he looks a little different to me.
Look!
Proper times?
Shona, you're going home. You're surviving.
Sure.
It's a pity we have to wake up, really. It's not really something we do every day, is it?
You're always such a downer, Doctor.
Just a little longer.
Every Christmas is last Christmas.
Oh, you know. About sixty two years. Doctor, I have missed you very much, you stupid old man.
Oh, probably won't work on you.
Go on, then.
Can you really see no difference in me?
How was what?
Oh, how was my life, you mean?
No. But there were plenty of proposals.
I turned them down. I travelled. I taught in every country in Europe. I learned to fly a plane.
Oh, hundreds.  I just wish there were time for a few more.
There was one other man, but that would never have worked out.
He was impossible.
Because every Christmas is last Christmas.
Doctor. Am I young?
Oh, that's good.
So?
Merry Christmas, Doctor.
Well, look at you, all happy. That's rare.
Hey. Sorry. So the famous drink at last.
Dinner, in fact.
I like a man who moves fast.
Yes, I know, I know, dessert.
Gotcha.
Good. You know. Teaching.
Teaching, teaching.
We probably shouldn't talk about work.
Though, do you take Courtney for anything?
She said she couldn't concentrate on her work, because my face was too wide.
I could kill that girl some days.
And from you, that means something.
I'm sorry?
Okay. Good. Good wells.
I'm not doubting the quality of your wells.
Okay. Point taken. Seriously.
I'm sorry I didn't mention your twenty three wells.
Sorry.
Don't you worry. He'll probably dig for it.
It's okay.
Yes. Can slightly see that.
People like me?
That really is exactly what you were doing.
I made a joke.
Yeah, well, do you know what I'm making now?
An exit.
Doctor?
What are you doing in here?
It was a disaster and I am extremely upset about it, since you didn't ask.
I can't.
No, it's just possible that I might get a phone call.
No, I haven't. I'm still wearing my make-up.
I haven't actually said yes.
Not what?
How long have you been travelling alone?
It looks like your handwriting.
Have you met you? What's all this?
I'll bet you have. What theory?
Have you had that dream?
No, that was me asking you. Have you had that dream?
No, I did.
Okay, yeah, probably. Yes. But everyone dreams about something under the bed.
What is it?
Why not?
Which I do not need a preview of.
What will we see?
Ooo!
Sorry, I think I got distracted.
Come on where?
Never been to Gloucester in my life, and I've never lived in a children's home.
Isn't it bad if I meet myself?
So why did you bring me out here?
Doctor, I
Doctor. If I had have been distracted, what would have happened?
Nothing. Er, I'm just. What's your name?
Oh. Okay. Hello, Rupert.
No, it isn't. I know somebody called Pink.
Why are you awake? Are you scared?
Hello.
Nice room. You know, you should have more than one chair. What do you do when people come round?
Why aren't you sitting on it, then? Do you think that there's something underneath it? Hey, everyone thinks that, sometimes. That's just how people think at night.
Did you have a dream? A hand grabbing your foot? You have, haven't you? You've had that exact dream.
Do you know why dreams are called dreams?
Because they're not real. If they were, they wouldn't need a name.
Do you know what's under there?
Me! Come on, It's perfectly safe. See? Nobody here, except us.
It's a house full of people. Of course you hear noises.
They're all dreaming.
If you're clever enough. But they can't harm you. You know, sometimes we think there's something behind us. And the space under your bed is what's behind you at night. Simple as that. There's nothing to be afraid of.
(quietly) Who else is in this room?
(quietly) Someone must have come in.
Hello? Who's this? This is a friend of yours playing a game. Playing a trick, are you, hey? A little trick on Rupert here? Okay. It's not funny this, you know.
Doctor?
Find who?
Wally?
Yeah. Come and see all the dark.
So, plan? Plans are good.
Is it gone?
Gone.
Shut up, leave this to me.
They're yours now.
People don't need to be scared by a big gray-haired stick insect, but here you are. Stay still, shut up. See what I'm doing? This is your army.
Sit! And they're going to guard under your bed. You see this one? This is the boss one, the colonel. He's going to keep a special eye out.
That's why he's the boss. A soldier so brave he doesn't need a gun. He can keep the whole world safe. What shall we call him?
Sorry?
Good. Good name.
Sure.
So is it possible we've just saved that kid from another kid in a bedspread?
I got distracted.
No. No, no, no. Of course not. Why do you ask?
Will er, will he remember any of that?
Doctor, I am sorry to ask, and, you know, I realise this is probably against the laws of time, or summat. Er, could you do me a favour?
Is that what I look like from the back?
I was thinking it was good.
Sorry.
Hello. I'm Clara Oswald. I'm a bit tricky, sometimes a bit up myself, and I do not like my surname, but I think that's basically everything you need to worry about.
Also, I mouth off when I'm nervous and I've got a mouth on me. Seriously, it's got a mind of its own. I'm really worried it wants to go solo.
Don't say anything. Or say something nice.
It's a start.
Drifting now.
No, Pink, Pink is nice. I like pink.
Ooo, a bold offer, Mister Pink.
I know, I know.
It's that foot you're keeping in your mouth.
Anyway. Clara Pink. Too much.
Mind you, Rupert Pink.
Er, ha, ha. Rupert Pink. It's not good.
Yeah. That was your name, yeah?
Er, someone in the school.
I cannot remember who it was.
No. No, no, no. No way.
Danny, nothing about this is any kind of joke.
My what?
Er, I'm really sorry. Danny. There is something I should probably be honest about.
Everything, in my case, is actually quite a lot.
No, no, no, it's not weird. Not really Where are you going?
Don't go.
It's not weird... Exactly.
I am trying to have a date. A real life, inter-human actual date! It's a normal nice, everyday, meeting-up sort of thing. And I would just like to know, is there any other way you can make this any more surreal than it already is?
Danny?
Orson Pink?
Connection?
How, how would I know?
How did you find him?
Okay.
Where are we?
The end of the universe?
To what?
Then how did he get here? If he's from a hundred years in my future
What happened?
A bit?
It's not a competition.
He looks like he's packing.
He can, yes.
Yeah, fine. I'm fine.
No. Nope.
Doctor.
Sorry. What?
Seen what?
You'll be safe in here. Nothing gets through those doors, I promise.
That would seem to be the plan. Wait for what exactly?
Like he said, it's recharging.
That's just how my face looks when he talks.
Right. Yes. Didn't do a very good job, did it?
Orson, do me a favour. Take my advice. When you get home, stay away from time travel.
What? Sorry, what do you mean, runs in the family?
What is it? Tell me. You asked if you knew me. It's a family heirloom?
What are we doing?
For what? For who? If everybody in the universe is dead, then there's nobody out there.
What's the other?
Do you have your own mood lighting now? Because, frankly, the accent is enough.
Where did that come from?
But who wrote it?
What is?
What's that?
A reassuring one?
Always thought there was something in the pipes.
Are you making conversation?
I told you. A date.
It's a date.
Do I have to bring him to you for approval?
Frankly, you've already done enough.
Or?
Why are we doing this? Why don't we just go?
Why? About what?
Okay, so...
What's that?
Potentially?
Doctor, you don't actually believe all this, do you? Hiding creatures, things from under the bed.
Did we come to the end of the universe because of a nursery rhyme?
That's you turning it, right?
Why?
Doctor. Doctor
Okay, okay. Somebody is out there. Now we know, we can leave. Oh, Doctor!
Is there even an atmosphere out there?
Because I am not going to leave you in danger!
You're an idiot.
He's opening the door.
Oh, no, no, no, not now, come on!
What's happening?
What's that?
Is he okay?
Something hit him.
Could've been that.
What was out there? What were you so afraid of?
Yeah.
You say probably a lot.
Probably.
Telepathic circuits. I left a trace in them before.
So apparently, that can do a thing.
It's not a plan, it's a thing. (quietly) Okay. Come on, come on, you can do it!
Come on! Sorry.
Here we go! Come on. Come on!
Come on. Come on!
I don't know. I think so.
Somewhere else. I hope. No, no, no, you stay and look after the Doctor.
Thing is, my timeline, it keeps on. Orson, you don't want to meet yourself. It's really embarrassing.
Rupert?
Orson?
It's okay. This is just a dream. Just lie back again. Just lie back on the bed. It will all be okay if you just lie down and go to sleep. Just do that for me. Just sleep.
Listen...
What if there was nothing? What if there never was anything? Nothing under the bed, nothing at the door. What if the big bad Time Lord doesn't want to admit he's just afraid of the dark.
Don't look where we are. Take off, and promise me you will never look where we've been.
Just take off. Don't ask questions.
Do as you're told.
This is just a dream. But very clever people can hear dreams. So, please, just listen. I know you're afraid, but being afraid is all right. Because didn't anybody ever tell you? Fear is a superpower. Fear can make you faster and cleverer and stronger. And one day, you're going to come back to this barn. And on that day you're going to be very afraid indeed.
I know.
It doesn't matter if there's nothing under the bed or in the dark, so long as you know it's okay to be afraid of it.
Me too.
You're always going to be afraid, even if you learn to hide it. Fear is like a companion. A constant companion, always there. But that's okay, because fear can bring us together.
Wonderful.
Of course it is.
Doing what?
Yeah, I'm smiling.
Sorry.
To end it. Yeah. It is. It's a good choice. A good one to end on.
Mmm hmm.
Mmm hmm,.
I really thought I hated you, you know?
I did. I did hate you. In fact, I hated you for weeks.
I went to a concert once. Can't remember who it was. But do you know what the singer said?
She said, "hatred is too strong an emotion to waste on someone that you don't like."
Shush. Shut up. Look, what I'm trying to say is, I don't hate you. I could never hate you. But I can't do this any more. Not the way you do it.
Yes. Go.
I'm sorry?
I'm Clara. This is the Doctor.
Sorry? Another what?
What's wrong with her? Did something happen?
There's a body and there's a mummy. I mean, can you not just get on a train? Did a wizard put a curse on you about mini-breaks?
And the monster?
Says the two thousand year old man.
No. No, look, fine. You know, if you think that there is nothing to worry about, then that is fine by me.
Ah, yes, I'm sure.
Our last, yeah. I mean, it's not like I'm never going to see you again.
Is it?
No, what I mean, you're going to come round for dinner or something, aren't you? Do you, do you do that? Do you come round to people's houses for dinner?
I don't know. I thought you might find it boring.
No.
To the last hurrah.
So, what are you saying? Just because he brought me somewhere cool, I shouldn't dump him?
Yeah. It's pretty boring, really.
Hello?  Are you OK? Hello? Excuse me? Excuse me?
Miss Pitt, wasn't it? Are you all right? Do you need some help?
Oh, OK. Er, I didn't say you were, but you've had a bad day. I think anybody could do with a little bit of help after a day like today.
Are you OK?
Er, yeah, I should think so. It's in there, is it? OK, I have a friend who's really good with locks. Do you want to come with me, see if we can find him?
Or you could do that because that works, too.
Nope. But I do need to be slightly more skilled than a high-heeled shoe.
Oh, yeah. All the time. Whoever designed this door, for a start.
Because you loved her very much and were missing her?
Hey, listen. You didn't do anything wrong. Difficult people, they can make you feel all sorts of things. But you didn't do it. You didn't kill her. She just died.
He's not my anything.
Yeah, Of course we're just friends. Oh. Well, not even friends, not any more.
It's true. It is. It's very true.
Seriously? We're stuck in this carriage, probably all night, and all we can talk about is some man?
Not that kind of. Look, we, er, we knocked about together, we travelled and now we're stopping. This is a, I don't know, goodbye to the good times?
Yeah. Now that you mention it...
Yes. Yes. Yes, he was.
Exactly.
I was saying goodbye. You can't end it on a slammed door.
Doctor?
Doctor, please, I'm in trouble...
Doctor...
Doctor, please, just...
Doc...
I'm trapped!
Yes. Yes. Hello. Can you hear us?
What?
What? What do you mean, it's not working? Why?
Well, I was looking for you...
Look, look, please, can we just not do this now? I think we might not be alone in here.  There's a sarcophagus.
I think we might just be about to find out. Turns out the sonic is working.
Doctor?
Doctor, it's OK. It's er, it's full of bubble wrap.
OK. So, first things first. The sarcophagus is actually a secure stasis unit.
Well, that would have been good to know.
Other ships. Maisie recognised a couple of the names. These are missing ships.
No.
The Gloriana spent three days getting picked off by the Foretold. All died. Performance marked as poor.
The Valiant Heart.   42 crew, four died.
OK, but, but we're in here and, if we stay in here, that thing can't...
OK, so you can save her? Right?
As it kills her.
How? How exactly? She's never going to agree to this.
He says. He says he can save you.
Yes. Yes, he is.
We passed the TARDIS on the way here. Thought about getting inside, hiding, pulling the levers and hoping for the best. But we couldn't even get in. There was a forcefield around it.
But how does he even know what it is? Cos if he knows what it is, then he knows what you are.
You knew. You knew this was no relaxing break. You knew this was dangerous.
OK, this. You see, this. This is why I'm leaving you. This. Because you lied. You lied to me, again. And now you've made me lie. You've made me your accomplice.
Maisie, I am, I am so sorry.
It's OK. I think we all can.
We were fighting that?
Listen, what I said...
I take it you know a way out?
Great! So use it!
Doctor!
Weren't we just on a train?
And?
Blew up the train?
So you saved everyone.
Hmm.
So, when you lied to Maisie, when you made me lie to Maisie...
So you were pretending to be heartless.
Do you love it?
I know it's scary and difficult, but do you love being the man making the impossible choice?
Because it's what you do, all day, every day.
Doesn't have to be. Is it like...
An addiction?
And you never have.
Hey, Danny. How are you?
Yep. Mission accomplished. Listen, I can't talk now but I'll see you soon and, er, I love you.
Huh. No accounting for taste.
He's fine with it.
Danny. He's fine with the idea of me and you knocking about. It was his idea that we stop but, he's decided he doesn't mind and neither do I. Oh, to hell with the last hurrah. Let's keep going.
Yeah, they happen.
Look, as long as you get me home safe and on time, everything is great. I am so sorry. I've had a wobble. It's a big wobble, but it's fine. Forget about it. Now, shut up and give me some planets.
Are you? Have you ever been sure?
Then what are you waiting for? Let's go!
Fun?
'Fraid not.
He looks a bit full of himself.
Smile! Say, &quot;Spacey Zoomer!&quot;
Right, wonderful day out, Doctor, but it's time to get the kids home.
Why not?
What reasons?
You collect funny insects?
Sleep well.
Was this really the biggest amusement park in the universe?
Who were we fighting?
You beat them, though - beat them or you wouldn't be here. How?
Nothing. It's just black. No stars, no nothing.
It's horrible.
Why?
You KNOW I didn't. She hasn't...
Come on.
Angie, Angie!
Angie!
Angie!
What?
Is that something they're likely to do?
Where are YOU going?
Good. We need to find somewhere defensible. Where?
Real castle? Drawbridge? Moat?
We'll go there.
Blowing-up-the-planet protocols?
Somewhere defensible. No blowing up the planet.
What would the Empire do if they WERE alerted?
After they got us off?
Drawbridge, moat - brilliant.
The only reason I'm still alive is because I do what the Doctor says.  Can you guarantee me you'd bring back my children alive and unharmed?  I trust the Doctor.
I'm not sure I'd go THAT far.
It's on its way, then. Weapons! Show me.  Only one gun?
What's this for? Just a mad guess here - it blows up the planet?
I'll have that, then.  Is there any other way to activate the bomb?
You will not activate it without a direct order from me.
Your orders come from me. Don't they?
Thanks.
I don't get it. Why would you blow up a whole planet, and everybody on it, just to get rid of one Cyberman?
Put it down, I forbid you!
The Doctor said to get somewhere easily defensible. But if we stay in the castle, it'll pick us off one by one. We have to take it out.
Yes.
You know what to do.
It's going to be hard to get in close enough.
Now!
What's happening to them?  One more step, and I fire!
You don't think that was the only one, then?
Did you get the kids? Are they all right? What's going on?
Bad news?
Complicated how?
Please tell me you can wake them up.
Other good news?
What?
You're playing chess with yourself?
Doctor...?
You aren't the Doctor.
Why am I impossible?
More Cybermen?
The Doctor will stop you.
Why am I the impossible girl?
Chess game - stakes?
That's not reassuring.
Please tell me you can fix what happened to the children.
That is not fine!
Which one of you said that?
Apparently there are more Cybermen on the way.
We might have more than a dozen Cybermen to worry about. What's that cable?
What'd happen if we dropped the end into the moat and turned it on?
Can Cybermen fly?
First good news of the day. Do it.
Oh, thank you, Porridge.
I'll see what he wants. Call me if there's any change.
One big gun, five of those hand pulsar units and a shiny black bomb that implodes the planet.
No.
In case you're not you right now. Or even if you are you, just in case.
Prove you're you. Tell me something only the Doctor knows.
Because even if that WAS true - which it's obviously not - I know you that you would rather die than say it. Finish your stupid game!
Doctor, let go.
Doctor?
What do you mean, he got what he wanted?
One gun, five hand pulsars and a planet-smashing bomb that doesn't work anymore.
Broken trigger unit.
Brilliant.
Damn.  Who's our best shot?
Shoot any of them who make it across. The rest of you, take defensive positions.  Porridge?
Keep yourself safe.
Woo-oo-oo.
Do you think I'm pretty?
Good enough.  What happened to the Cyber-Planner?
Why?
You are full of surprises.  Porridge?
So you can save us?
You don't have to be lonely.
What?
You - not one word. This is between me and the... Emperor. Porridge, I...don't want to rule 1,000 galaxies.
I'm really sorry.
Thank you, Doctor.
Kids' day out, getting us off the planet alive, whatever you were doing with the Cybermen...
Good night.  See you next Wednesday.
Right.
Well, there is something, someone that I've always wanted to meet. But I know what you'll say.
You'll say he's made up, that there is no such thing.
It's. It's Robin Hood.
Yeah. I love that story. I've always loved it, ever since I was little.
Yeah.
Ah, you see?
And what about you?
Yeah, you. You stop bad things happening every minute of every day. That sounds pretty heroic to me.
What?!
You said it was my choice.
Doctor.
Doctor! My choice. Robin Hood. Show me.
Might be a little bit much, but what do you reckon, Doctor?
Is that?
Oh, my God. Oh, my God! It is, isn't it? You found him. You actually found Robin Hood.
You're amazing.
Ahem.
Takes one to know one.
Doctor!
Doctor?
Oh!
Oh, I cannot believe this. You, you really are Robin Hood and his Merry Men.
Excuse me. Sorry. What are you doing?
Oh, shut up.
No. No, he's not really. Not most of the time. Dark days?
You said that these were dark days. What did you mean?
And the Sheriff. Cos there is a sheriff, right?
Why are you so sad?
Because the Doctor's right, you laugh too much.
Yes.
Sorry. Do go on.
What was she called?
Marian?
Oh, yes. I have always known her.
So?
Climate change?
No! Don't, don't go. It's a trap.
How can you be so sure he is not the real thing?
When did you stop believing in everything?
Don't you know? In a way, it's rather sweet.
I'm fine. I take Year Seven for after school Tae Kwon Do.
What are you up to?
Yep.
Oh, you two, SHUT UP! Do either of you understand, in any way at all, that there isn't actually a guard out there?
I said, shut up. The Doctor and Robin Hood locked up in a cellar. Is this seriously the best that you can do? You're determined to starve to death in here squabbling.
It is not a competition about who can die slower.
There was supposed to be a plan. Do either of you two have a plan?
Okay. Robin, you first.
Doctor, shut up. Robin, your plan.
Thank you, Prince of Thieves. Last of the Time Lords?
Can you explain your plan without using the word sonic screwdriver? Because you might have forgotten the Sheriff of Nottingham has taken your sonic screwdriver, just saying. It's always the screwdriver.
Oh, for God's sake!
Seriously.
I had a bag of crisps this morning, thanks.
Mmm, I should think they are.
You can take the girl out of Blackpool.
You're the one with the robot army, you tell me.
Ah. Good, yes, I was hoping we'd get round to that.
Mmm. For I have known I was destined to draw the eye of a great and powerful man for a long time. Ever since I saw those mysterious lights in the sky.
And those strange mechanical men, with their promises.
Really? Well, I would never have guessed. Tell me your story.
Oh, no, no, no, no. But you have to go first.
Because great men always precede.
Your story, then.
I can almost picture him. I don't even have to close my eyes.
Prince John?
Then came the lights in the sky, and everything changed.
I'd almost call it a crash. I remember it well.
And I suppose the mechanical men saw you as their natural leader?
It isn't?
Right.
Worksop?
So what are you hanging around here for, then, Your Majesty? Why are you bothering to squeeze pips out of peasants if you've got a skyship on stand-by?
Oh, but I do not have one. I was lying.
Yeah. People are so much better at sharing information if they think the other person has already got it.
Thank you.
For what?
Right, you do that again and you'll regret that.
Doctor?
We can't just let them kill him!
What the hell are you doing?
No!
Hi.
What is this? Why are you interrogating me?
Hiya!
Hell, yeah.
Fine, yeah.
Doctor
That was amazing.
Where did what go?
Doctor, what are you suggesting?
You're good at this. I saw you. You won the tournament.
Oh, brilliant. Right, let me have a go.
Still not keen on the laughing thing?
Woo-hoo! I'm going to miss you. You're very naughty.
Marian is very lucky, too.
Don't give up. Not ever. Not for one single day.
Be safe, if you can be. But always be amazing.
Goodbye, Robin Hood.
Admit it. You like him.
Do you ever get the feeling like you're being watched?
Why is it so dark?
So, orbit around Neptune?
Looks like a Japanese restaurant. Oh! Have you brought me to a space restaurant!?
Do what?
What about spacesuit?
We're here to assess stress.
Doctor...!
Ah, see? Not just "pirates". " pirates"!
We still don't know where we are.
I still can't shake the feeling.
"Grown"?!
What does she mean "grown"?
That's disgusting!
I'm OK.
What are these?
Morpheus? Named after the God of Dreams? Oh, yeah. Ooh, yeah! Not just this. So, what are they, then? Sleep pods?
First, tell me what those things are.
Doctor!
Huh? It dragged me in! The wires, they were like snakes, like it was alive!
Yeah. It just kind of flicked over my eyes. Did I sleep?
Why did it just grab at me?
Careful! Here. Let me try.
Hello-o? It's OK. We're not going to hurt you. Will you open up now? Come on. Let's start with names, shall we? Um, I'm Clara. This is the Doctor.
It's OK.
A month?
That's insane. That's !
When?!
OK, how, Doctor, how can those things be made of "sleep dust"?
So, the longer you're in Morpheus, the more the dust builds up?
Where are they, then? Where's the crew?
How come you're the only one left?
Listen to him, for God's sake! He knows what he's talking about! Doctor! Doctor, if the grav-shields are decaying...
We're being pulled towards Neptune!
Argh, this day couldn't get any worse!
No! No!
Oh, God. Of all the places! A cold store. Nagata, are you OK?
What about the others?
We have to go after them!
Doctor!
That's what they do, isn't it? Kill people?
They evolve. You said so yourself.
What now? We can't stay in here. We're going to freeze to death. And we can't go back out there because the Sandmen will get us.
Yeah, it's a good name. It fits. Like the song. ? Bah, bah, bah... ?
All right. Sorry.
OK, well, what would you prefer then? The "Dustmen"?
Doctor, that door isn't going to last much longer. So, what do we do?
Sssh!
"Paranoia", you said.
Me?
Well...
OK, well, we'll fix this. You will fix this.
Sure?
OK then. Let's get on with it. The power's been almost entirely out since we arrived. But we've still got emergency lighting. But the engines are still on.
What, what, what, what, what?
And that's what you want?! You're helping them wipe out Humanity?
What's in there? Dust?
But you said it was an encoded signal. Something electronic in the Morpheus process that changed the chemical reaction in the brain.
Doctor! Doctor!
No!
Is that your answer for everything?!
What?
Well, you heard what he said. That's the first Morpheus patient!
And then they make Sandmen, they conglomerate.
Look, can we maybe have this conversation when we get off this thing?
I've never been so pleased to see...
What?! Urgh!
Rigsy! Hey, what's wrong?
Angie, is the internet working? Trying to phone the helpline, they won't answer.
Can I use it when you're finished?
You done your homework?
And I'm not trying to be. OK?
I'm OK, I'll be upstairs trying to figure out my computer.
I'm here as long as you need me.
What chapter you on?
11's the best. You'll cry your eyes out.
Oh, come on, just answer, just pick it up, pick it up, pick it up.
Ah, hello. I can't find the internet.
It's gone, the internet. Can't find it anywhere. Where is it?
Yes, the internet. Why don't I have the internet?
I've got half past 3:00. Am I phoning a different time zone?
Will it show up on the bill?
Woman in the shop wrote it down. It's the helpline, isn't it? She said it was the best helpline out there. In the universe, she said.
I dunno, the woman in the shop. So why isn't there internet? Shouldn't it just sort of... be there?
Hang on. Erm... Wi-Fi?
It's asking me for a password.
Sure. What's the password for the internet?
How am I supposed to remember that?
Hang on. Just a mo.  Run. You. Clever. Boy. And. Remember. One!
Two!
and remember.
Three!
Don't shout, you made me type it wrong. It's thrown me out again. What do I do, how do I get back in?
It was just a thing to remember the password. Run, you clever boy and remember. Oh, hang on!
Hello, yes, I hear you. Yep. Uh-huh.  Hello?
Hello?
Just Clara Oswald. What was that middle one?
No. Should I? Who are you?
Doctor who?
Could I what?
Doctor who?
Doctor who?
OK.
Why are you still here? Why are you here at all?
That was you?
How did you get here so fast?
When you say &quot;mobile phone&quot;, why do you point at that blue box?
OK, we're finished now.
Angie? Angie, are you upstairs? Angie, are you still here?
Hello.
Are you a friend of Angie's?
What where you doing upstairs?
I know you, don't I?
Hello?
I don't understand.
I don't know...
â€¦where I am.
I don't know where I am. Where am I? Please tell me, where I am! I don't know where I am.
I don't know where I am!
I don't know where I am! I don't understand. I don't know where I am! I don't know where I am!
I don't understand! I don't know where I am! Where am I? I don't know where I am. I don't know where I am.
Hello?
I'm in bed.
Don't remember going.
What did I miss?
Assembled the what?
I don't think you did.
What happened to me?
I was scared. Really scared. I didn't know where I was.
Yes.
Are you guarding me?
Are you seriously going to sit down there all night?
Well, then. I'll have to come to you.
It isn't mine, I'm a friend of the family.
Just like what?
Are you going to explain what happened to me?
Isn't that basically Twitter?
What's that face for?
Why would you say that?
Oh. Oh. That's weird. I know all about computers now in my head. Where did that come from?
I'm sorry?
Both of us?
I bet I will!
What is that box, anyway? Why do you have a box?
Is it like a snogging booth?
Is that what you do, you bring a booth? There's such a thing as too keen.
What's going on? Is the Wi-Fi switching on the lights?
What is that thing?
I saw a little girl.
Doctor! Doctor!
What's going on?
All our lights on, everyone else's off. Why?
I'm sorry?
But... but... but... it's...
Bigger. On the inside. Actually bigger.
Are we going back out there?
Away from the plane?
How did we get here?
Is this the plane, the actual plane?  Are they all dead?
What is going on? Is this real? Please tell me what is happening!
No!
OK. When are you going to explain what the hell is going on?
What? I ain't waiting till breakfast.
Garage?
So, this is tomorrow, then? Tomorrow's come early.
If you've got a flying time machine, why are we on a motorbike?
Because it's made of wood?
So if we can travel anywhere in time and space, why did we travel to the morning? What's the point in that?
Yes.
Are you an alien?
Fine, yeah. I think I'm fine.
So what happens if you do find them? What then?
You don't have a plan?
What?
People always have plans.
About a year, since their mum died.
Gimme!
You need to know where they physically are. Their exact location.
I can do it.
You've hacked the lower operating system. I'll have their physical location in under five minutes. Go and get a coffee.
They uploaded me, remember. I've got computing stuff in my head.
I have insane hacking skills.
And I can find them in under five minutes, plus photographs. 27?
Coffee - go get. Five minutes, I promise.
It's never about the security, it's about the people.
Why do you keep looking at me like that?
Victorian?
What, like you, for instance? Down, boy!
Sure, setting up stuff, need a user name.
Clara Oswald for the win! Oswin!
I did it. I really did, I did it. I found them.
The Shard. They're in the Shard. Floor 65.
Are you listening to me, Doctor? I found them!
Doctor? Doctor, help me. I don't know where I am. I don't understand. I don't know where I am! Please help me. I don't know where I am! I don't know where I am. Doctor, please, please, help me. I don't know where I am.
Doctor, help me. Help! Help! Please!
Doctor?  Doctor! Doctor!
So. He comes back, does he?
What question?
I was going to travel. I came to stay for a week before I left and during that week...
I keep the book cos I'm still going.
Does this work? Eh? Is this actually what you do? Do you just crook your finger and people just jump in your snog box and fly away?
I'll be the judge of that!
Come back tomorrow, ask me again.
Cos tomorrow, I might say yes. Some time after 7.00 OK for you?
See you then.
Uh-huh?
That wasn't a leaf, that was page one.
There's no way out of this. We're going to die here.
They're in my pocket.
In my other jacket. At home.
Look, I don't have the vibro-cutters. If I had the vibro-cutters, I wouldn't be able to pass you the vibro-cutters. We're going to starve to death out here.
Hiya. Sorry I'm late.
Sunbed. I'll get 'em in. Usual?
What are they like?
How's you?
Freak shower.
I said freak.
How much further?
Yeah.
Oh, yeah. Danny. Hiya.
I can't keep doing this. I can't do it. Yes, I can, I can do it, of course I can do it. I've got it all under control.
So, where we off to?
Why are you being nice?
What thing?
You're being mysterious, and do you know what means?
Hmm. It means that you are a very clever man making the mistake, common to very clever people, of assuming that everybody else is stupid. Where are you going?
Can you do deep cover?
Have you seen you?
When's that?
Hmm. Hmm. I'll be sure to have a wash.
Morning, Mister Pink.
Do they know?
Yeah, course I'm OK. Why wouldn't I be OK?
What?
Sorry. Er, I've had a... thing and, er, the thing's gone, so I'm all yours.
Nothing.
The next few days are all about you. I promise.
Know who?
Never seen him before in my life.
No, I think that was just a sort of general wink, you know? He winked at everybody. It was a general welcoming wink. Ah, I have, er, left some marking. Assembly. Chop-chop. Off you pop. Catch you in a bit. Excuse me.
You're wearing a different coat.
Deep cover in my school? Why? Where's Atif, what have you done with him?
Is it aliens? Oh, my God, is that why you're here? Are there aliens?
Are there aliens in this school?
Doctor, is there an alien in this school?
You can't do this. You cannot pass yourself off as a real person among actual people.
Human beings are not otters!
OK. One question. And you will answer this question. Are the kids safe?
I hate you.
Yes, Kelvin, I'm fine. You carry on.
Can I help you, Mister Smith?
I'm sorry?
Oh, no, no, no, no. You don't do this. You are the caretaker, this is not what you do.
Not your area!
This is Mister Smith, the temporary caretaker, and he's a bit confused.
Oh, What? I suppose she was your bezzie mate, was she? And you went on holidays together and then you got kidnapped by Boggons from space and then you all formed a band and met Buddy Holly.
Get down.
Go.
Right, that's it. Well done, Kelvin. Get going. See you all in a couple of days. Thanks very much.
Who asks for homework? Amateur.
Hello, Tobias, can't really stop.
Tobias, you can do whatever you want.
Actually, I, er yes.
Courtney, you are big enough to look after yourself. Next class, jog on, I need to talk to Mister Pink.
What was that?
Er, excuse me. Mister Pink, I think class 9M4 are waiting.
So, Pink? The name remind you of anything?
Colonel Orson Pink? The guy we met at the end of the universe.
Looks very like him.
Oh, never mind. What are you doing? What, what's in there?
Is who here?
If he is, are you going to start talking like a normal human being?
Doctor
No. Yes.
Sorry, what, Adrian?
You see what?
Yes, sorry, of course.
Why are you talking like an idiot?
Mmm, yes, good point, Ade.
Hey, I said you could play chess, I did not say you could play football on the chessboard. Jack, Morgan, come on, help me out, clear it up.
Sorry, what did you say? What was she doing in here?
What were they like?
The others before me. Did they let you get away with this kind of thing? This school is in danger.
From you.
You wouldn't be here if there wasn't an alien threat nearby. Your strategy for dealing with it involves endangering this school.
I don't know anything because you haven't told me anything, which means I wouldn't approve, which means you are endangering this school.
What's that?
Because the alternative would be developing a conscience of your own. Scanning for what?
You still do. Pay attention.
What the hell is it?
Then leave it alone.
So, your insanely dangerous plan is?
A new watch. Tiny bit disappointed.
Doctor? Oi! Ow! Did you just flick my nose? You're invisible. Ha, ha! Oh, my God, that's incredible.
All right, where are you?
So you're, you're leading the thing here? To a school? My, my school?
And me. You're not doing this alone.
You did recognise him.
Oh, of course you recognised him. I. Sorry. Stupid. I, I underestimated you.
And you, you like him?
Just this once, I'm doing what I'm told.
So easy.
Ah, Mister, Mister Pink.
There's a specific frown?
A thing?
Tomorrow's parents' evening.
No. Not all evening.
Er, who? The caretaker?
Well, he speaks very highly of you.
Good night, Mister Pink.
Canoodling cancelled, if you need a hand. Doctor? You invisible? I am so going to confiscate that watch.
Doctor? Where are you?
No! No, no, no, no! Doctor, stop! Doctor!
Danny, what are you doing here?
I saw the thing, yeah. Doctor, are we safe? Is the planet safe? It's gone?
But the chronodyne worked. It's gone.
Then when?
It's a play! For the summer fete.
Yes, it's a play. Shut up, it is a play. We are rehearsing a play. Shh, shh, shh, shh. A surprise play. And, er, you see, the vortex thing is, is a lighting effect. Very clever. And that thing is, is one of the kids. In fancy dress. Really, really good fancy dress.
We do not look the same age.
Doctor, stop!
He's my boyfriend.
He's my boyfriend. I thought you'd figured this out.
Yes, him.
Yes, he is.
Because I love him!
(sighs) There is no surprise play.
Who? Adrian? No, no, no. He's just a friend and not my type.
The Doctor is
Because he's an alien.
No, no, no, I'm still from Blackpool. Me and the Doctor, we travel through time and space.
It's called a TARDIS, but it's disguised as an old police phone box.
And it's bigger on the inside than the outside.
And we travel the universe in it.
Yes.
Will you be OK?
Come on, Danny. It's all right, it's. Come on, it's all fine. You'll be OK. Let's er, get those legs moving. That's it, down those stairs. Yep, that's it. This can all be explained and everything will be fine.
How do you mean?
What do you think? Say something.
I don't elope.
No.
Not in that way.
You know what I mean.
Danny
Because it's amazing. Because I see wonders.
What are you thinking?
Please, tell me how I fix this.
You know who I am.
OK, I think we've just got time before parents' evening.
Press the button on the side, you're invisible. You'll see me with the Doctor, the other me. The exactly the same other me. OK?
His name's Danny. And no, I haven't. I've er, I explained it all to him. He gets it. He took it really well.
So, when the Blitzer comes back, are you going to catch him with that?
If it comes back Thursday night, are you sure about that? Cos you said the chronodyne is unstable.
He's a maths teacher.
Not a soldier.
What is?
But you can't. The Skovox thing.
I don't think we should, not this time.
I just think, with the school in danger
Danny, why are you?
Danny.
Doctor, this is stupid, this is unfair.
Danny, it's not time to go home yet. It's parents' evening.
Courtney Woods' mum and dad.
Sorry, Mrs Christodolou, I think er, I think the caretaker wants me too.
Yeah, she's great, yeah, a really great girl,  A plus, ten out of ten, top of the class. Sorry. Although, actually, handwriting could be better.
What's happening?
Quickly. What do I do?
Then what?
On my way.
Here we go.
Doctor, now! It's got to be now!
Doctor!
You're green!
Why's it listening to you?
Do it now!
Me? What can I do?
Oh, my God! Oh, my God, you were amazing! Oh, my God, you were so brilliant.
Just OK?
What? What one thing?
He, er, he did just save the whole world.
So, what do you think of him now?
Yeah. See, he's all right, isn't he, really, underneath it all.
OK. Tell me what you're thinking.
I trust him. He's never let me down.
Yeah, it's a deal.
OK. I promise.
Don't say that.
Yes. We're clear.
Doctor! Doctor!
Doctor, help me!
Doctor, I think there's something in my space suit.
OK, explain?
It's halfway up my leg.
Doctor...
There's a blue one, quite big. Two little yellowish ones just below.
Yes! It's on the back of my neck, I can feel it.
Yes! Yes, I can.
Doctor! DOCTOR!
How did we do?
What about all the Velosians? Are they safe?
What's to stop them re-arming and trying again?
You're always talking about what you can and can't do but you never tell me the rules.
You are a tidal wave.
Doctor...?
Yeah?
Plan, Doctor? Any time soon.
Yeah, so you keep saying for two days on a longboat.
Only because you kept saying, "I do have a plan."
There you go.
You all right? Do you know her?
OK, so, why are you staring?
What happens?
OK, plan.
Which is?
How?
It's going to be the yo-yo again, isn't it?
How did you do that?!
That's not really Odin, is it?
So this is an invasion.
We have to help them.
Have you still got the eye-patch thing?
Point it at my chains and think the word open. Say it with your mind.
No, wait! Wait!
Use your blades, try to jam it!
Come on! Come on!
Quick! Pull!
Quickly!
Ssh!
I'm sorry. I didn't mean to make you afraid.
Except you've already analysed that and you know it's a technology from a civilisation vastly more powerful than your own. And er, you will have also noticed that... I'm wearing a space suit. So, I'm not from around here, and it's highly unlikely I will have come alone. You see, you haven't killed us because killing us would start a fight you didn't come here to have... and you're not sure you can win.
Ooh, hello. Time for your medication?
OK, you mash up Vikings to make warrior juice, nice.
Why play God?
You're not a farmer. You're a thief, caught in the act.
Hush! Go, now. Go and find Vikings on other planets. The universe is full of testosterone. Trust me, it's unbearable. We won't follow you, see? We don't need to fight.
Ask yourself, is this a war you really want?
We were about to leave.
No, no, no, listen to me.
Oh, please. Shut up.
Why are you doing this?
No!
OK.
Listen...
OK.
The deadliest warrior race in the galaxy?
Because I think this village just declared war on them.
They're coming here tomorrow, ten of them, to kill everybody in the village.
Um... he speaks Baby.
"Just one village?"
What's it saying?
Tell me.
You just decided to stay. The baby stopped crying.
He's just warming up. He hasn't got a plan yet. But he will have... and it will be spectacular.
More recently, Chuckles hit Lofty over the head, on his helmet, with his sword, which knocked him out. There was a little blood, which you saw and... did that. Only, the first time you did it, you knocked a torch onto some hay, which spooked a horse, who kicked open a gate, and er, I'm... sure you can fill in the rest.
Weird sounding thunder.
Well?
I keep waiting to hear what your real plan is.
Turning them into fighters? That's not like you.
What happened?
It doesn't matter how well you train them, it's not going to make difference.
A good death? Is that the best they can hope for?
No problem.
You've made an impact there.
She's nice. Fight you for her.
I've got a hobby, thanks. It's you, by the way.
Not this.
Don't even ask.
I'm not running.
No, you don't, because I never asked for that.
Well, stop thinking about me, and start think about them, because you're missing something.
How you're going to win. You always miss it, right up until the last minute. So put down your sword, stop playing soldier and look for it. Start winning, Doctor. It's what you're good at.
You're shouting. What's happened? Did you trap your finger in something again?
Doctor, explain. What's happening?
How?
Seriously, how?
Eels?
Plan, then?
That is rubbish.
Don't move.
How's it coming?
You got it? Great.
See, that was really funny.
See, all it needed was the Benny Hill theme.
Get the helmet off her. Get it off, now.
No pulse. I think. Doctor, is she dead?
Heart failure, yeah?
You didn't lose. You saved the town.
You did your best. She died. There's nothing you can do.
What? What's wrong?
Doctor, what's wrong with your face?
OK, what's it for?
Saving her... I think.
Then who's it for?
OK, it's official. Silence is even worse in a Scottish accent. Are you going to tell me what you're brooding about?
Well, good.
The ability?
If the repair kit never stops working, then why did you give her two?
Whatever you did for Ashildr... I think she deserved it.
How will you know which one's yours?
Fine, then. Right. Now, where was I? Jane Austen. Amazing writer, brilliant comic observer, and strictly among ourselves, a phenomenal kisser.
Everybody turn on their phones. News websites and Twitter.
Hashtag: #ThePlanesHaveStopped
Yeah, that would probably be UNIT.
Mister Dunlop, sorry. I have to take the rest of the day off owing to a, er, personal crisis.
Yes. Yes, yes, yes, I'm coming. No, don't send a helicopter. Think it through.
We don't know enough yet. He doesn't appreciate gossip.
How many planes?
That's a lot of fuel.
OK, so, what could you do with 4,000 flying bombs?
I dunno. Er, fault lines. Earthquake, a tsunami?
What kind of an attack advertises? Why show somebody what you can do? Why not just do it? What's actually happened to the planes? What are the pilots saying?
Kate, we can't just phone the Doctor and bleat, he'll go Scottish. Come on. What have we got? What do we know? It's not an attack, it's not an invasion, because, well, that doesn't come with a fair warning. So, somebody needs our attention. Somebody who needs to put a gun to our heads to make us listen. Oh.
Sorry, what?
Then who is it?
Texting? Definitely not the Doctor.
Still dead, yeah. How come you're still alive?
That happens, now and then.
A what?
You said... I thought...
You?
I'm just what?
Since when do you care about the Doctor?
He's not your friend. You keep trying to kill him.
Mmm. Must be love.
So the Doctor is your bezzy mate and I'm supposed to believe that you've turned good?
No!
Stop it. Just stop it. Don't shoot anybody else!
Missy, nobody else!
No.
Start with me. Then what, hey?  came here for  help.
Make me believe you.
Release the planes.
Yeah. On my command.
Your best friend is in danger. Show me you care. Make me believe.
What does it say?
His confession.
Then it won't open, will it?
Here.
How's a Time Lord supposed to die?
We're looking for a party!
There he is. "Do not go gentle into that good night."
OK, how do we find him? How do we know what we're looking for?
What's the matter with him? He's never like this.
Wait, hang on. Did he just hear that? He doesn't know we're here, does he?
How did you know I was here? Did you see me?
What, one face in all of that crowd?
Wow, we're doing charm as well, now, are we? Which one of us is dying?
OK. And we're doing hugging now, too. I can't keep up.
OK, look. I guessed a party, but not like this. What is this? This isn't you.
That's yours.
Was?
Shame. You're ashamed. Doctor? What have you done?
We're coming with him. Both of us, her and me.
The Daleks?
What is that?
How long have we been waiting?
Doctor. You sent Missy your confession dial.
My point is, we both saw her die on Earth, ages ago. And obviously you knew that wasn't real. Or worse, hoped it wasn't. Either way, I think you've been lying.
Don't apologise. Make it up to me. There, see? Ha. Now you have to come back.
Gravity?
No.
How can you and the Doctor be friends?
You spend all your time fighting.
What do you mean?
What day?
What are you doing? Are you opening it?
Missy, we'll get sucked out!
What are you doing?
What, there's a floor?
That's ridiculous.
Why would anybody hide a whole planet?
What? What is it? Where are we?
What's Skaro?
The TARDIS. How did she get here?
Yeah? Yeah, well, if you're trying to get inside, you can't. Nothing can enter the TARDIS.
Yeah, well, good luck, because she's indestructible.
Doctor?
Sorry. But you're about to make a very big mistake.
I don't know where I am. It's like I'm breaking into a million pieces. And there's only one thing I remember.
I have to save the Doctor.
He always looks different.
Doctor! ..but I always know it's him.
Sometimes I think I'm everywhere at once.  Running every second, just to find him.
Doctor!
Just to save him.
Doctor!
Doctor?
But he never hears me.  Oi!
Almost never.
I blew into this world on a leaf.
I'm still blowing.
I don't think I'll ever land.
I'm Clara Oswald, I'm the impossible girl, I was born to save The Doctor.
My mum's soufflé, yeah. This time I'll get it right. This time I will be Soufflé Girl!
Because, Artie, like my mum always said - the soufflé isn't the soufflé, the soufflé is the recipe!
She was a great woman.  What's this?
Where am I?
Assistant?
Oh, yeah, of course he has. Professor Song. Sorry, it's just I never realized you were a woman.
Which is?
What, you know his name? He told you?
How?
So you're a... friend of his, then?
What's happened to her?
Tell him what?
Doctor?
What are you doing?
At which point, they suggested Blind Man's Bluff.
At the cinema.
So who was she? The lady with the funny name and the space hair.
What, like an ex?
&quot;The Doctor has a secret he will take to the grave. It is discovered.&quot;
Doctor?
Yeah.
Well?
Ow!
OK. What is Trenzalore? Is it your big secret?
OK, what then?
Where?
How can you have a grave?
But you're not going to. You just said it's the one place you must never go.
None at all. How can we save them?
What's that?
Now what?
So we're not there.
So. How do we get down there? Jump?
You OK? Visiting your own grave - anyone would be scared.
Meaning?
Gravestones are a bit basic.
Why are some of them bigger?
Well. Bright side - it's a helluva monument.
I can see that.
That can't be right.
She's not dead.
But I met her!
Doctor!
What do you think the gravestone really is?
Maybe it's a false grave.
Maybe it's a secret entrance to the tomb!
Your what?
Where are we?
So how come I met your dead wife?
Doctor!
I know, I know.  How do I know? How do I know that?
Have we, have we done this before?  We have! We have done this before, climbing through a wrecked TARDIS - you said things, things I'm not supposed to remember.
What did you mean, you keep meeting me? You said I died! How could I die?
What do you mean I died?
Doctor!
Doctor! Doctor!
That was not nice.
What's that?
Doctor, explain. What is that?
Doctor! Doctor!
What's wrong with him? What's happening?
What did you say?
Did you say the Dalek Asylum?
The Dalek Asylum. You said it was me that saved you. How? Victorian London. How, how could I have been in Victorian London?
I have to go in there.
But this is what I've already done. You've already seen me do it. I'm the Impossible Girl, and this is why.
If I step in there... what happens?
But the echoes could save the Doctor, right?
But they'll be real enough to save him.  Like my mum said, the souffle isn't the souffle - the souffle is the recipe.  It's the only way to save him, isn't it?
Well, how about that? I'm Souffle Girl after all.
If this works, get out of here as fast as you can. And spare me a thought now and then.
In fact, you know what?  Run. Run, you clever boy. And remember me.
'I don't know where I am...'
'..I just know I'm running.'
Sometimes it's like I've lived a thousand lives in a thousand places.
I'm born, I live, I die.
'And always, there's the Doctor.
Always, I'm running to save the Doctor,
Again...
and again...
and again.
Oi!  And he hardly ever hears me.
But I've always been there.
Doctor?
Right from the very beginning.  Sorry. But you're about to make a very big mistake. Don't steal that one, steal this one.  The navigation system's knackered, but you'll have much more fun.
Right from the day he started running.
And remember me.
I don't know where I am. I don't know where I'm going, or where I've been. I was the born to save the Doctor, but the Doctor is safe now. I'm the Impossible Girl and my story is done.
Doctor?
DOCTOR!
Please! Please, I don't know where I am.
I can't see you.
I can see you.
All your different faces, they're here.
What's wrong, what's happening?
Well, get out, then!
I don't even know who I am.
How?
Who's that?
But who is he?
But I never saw that one. I saw all of you. 11 faces, all of them you. You're the 11th Doctor.
I don't understand.
So we're moving through actual time?  So what's it made of? Time? If you can just rotor through it, it must be made of stuff, like jam's made of strawberries. So what's it made of?
And we can go anywhere?
So, we could go backwards in time?
And forwards in time.
I don't know. You know when someone asks you your favourite book and you forget every book you've read?
Well. That's a thing. That happens.
OK. So... So... So...  So, I'd like to see... I would like to see... What I would like to see is...  something awesome.
Mm-hm.
Yes. No. Yes.
It's...
More what?
What is it?
The who of what?
All life?
Did it?
Can we see it? Up close?
Where are they from?
What do I call them?
You've been here before?
Hang on.
So, why's everyone here?
Whoa!
Erm, Doctor?
What's happening? Why's it angry?
Doreen?
So, how much does it cost?
That's horrible.
Then you pay.
You're a thousand years old. You must have something you care about.
Are you okay?
Who?
Who?
Hello?
Hey! Are you OK? Are you lost?
Are you all right?
What are you doing?
Oh. Why?
Sorry, actually not.
To help. You looked lost.
I've got no idea who you might be. I've never been here before, I've never even been anywhere like here before. I just saw a little girl who looked like she needed help.
Really, really.
That's why I'm still here.
I know the perfect box.
A space-shippy thing. Timey, spacey.
You wait!  Oh, come on.
I don't know. I don't think it likes me.  Come on. Let me in.
Hey!  Hey, little girl!
So what's happening? Is someone trying to hurt you?
Of what?
OK. Can you pretend like I'm totally a space alien and explain?
Really not local. Sorry.
OK.
Every single one? Blimey. I hated history.
Everyone's scared when they're little. I used to be terrified of getting lost. Used to have nightmares about it. And then I got lost. Blackpool beach, Bank Holiday Monday. About ten billion people. I was about six. My worst nightmare come true.
The world ended. My heart broke. And then my mum found me. We had fish and chips and she drove me home and she tucked me up and she told me a story.
Oh, I was scared lots of times. But never of being lost. So, this special song. What are you scared of, exactly?
And do you think you'll get it wrong? Because I don't. I don't think you'll get it wrong. I think you, Merry Gejelh, will get it very, very right.
Exploring.
Where are we going now?
Sorry. Sorry.  Are we even supposed to be here?
But are we?
What are they singing?
What are they doing?
OK. What's happening? Is this supposed to happen?
Is somebody going to do something? Excuse me? Is somebody going to help her?
Why are we walking away? We can't just walk away. This is my fault! I talked her into doing this!
Well, you must have something, all the places you've seen.
You're 1,000 years old. And that's it, your spanner?
It's my Mum's.
Merry!
Brakes! Brakes!
I can't.
Why?
Sorry.
Can you open it?
How can they just stand there and watch?
And she's a child.
Merry! Merry, hold on! We'll be there soon! Doctor?
Hello what?
Meaning?
Uh-huh?
Merry, we need to leave.
Not without you.
You didn't get it wrong.
Well, he's ugly. But, you know, to be honest...  I don't think he looks big enough.
Did you just lock us in?
With the soul-eating monster.
And is there actually a way to get out?
Ideally, yes.
Doctor, why is he still singing?
It's awake? What's it doing?
She didn't say stories, she said souls.
Stop it. You're scaring her.
Having a nice stretch?!
Something's coming. What's coming?
Don't you dare.
You know all the stories. You must know if there's another way out.
And the secret songs open the secret door? How does it go? Can you sing it?
Doctor!
Where did they go?
Well, you could sound happier about it.
What boo-boo?
Sorry, a bit lost. Who's the Old God? Is there an Old God?
Oh, my stars. What do we do?
I say leg it.
Don't know. Lake District?
You're going to fight it, aren't you?
It's really big.
Really?
I'm staying with you.
Yes, I am. I can... assist.
What about that stuff you said? &quot;We don't walk away.&quot;
I think he is. I think he's very frightened.
So do I.
Still hungry?  Well, I brought something for you. This.  The most important leaf in human history.
The most important leaf in human history. It's full of stories, full of history.
And full of a future that never got lived. Days that should have been that never were.
Passed on to me.
This leaf isn't just the past, it's a whole future that never happened. There are billions and millions of unlived days for every day we live. An infinity. All the days that never came. And these are all my mum's.
It looks different.
You were there. At Mum's grave. You were watching. What were you doing there?
Of what?
Who?
Well, whoever she was, I'm not her, OK? If you want me to travel with you, that's fine. But as me. Not a bargain basement stand-in for someone else. I not going to compete with a ghost.
Who did?
Did you make this snowman?
Well, who did? Cos it wasn't there a second ago. It just appeared, from nowhere.
What, snow that can remember? That's silly.
Nothing. Still talking to you, ain't I?
Clara.
Oi!  Where are you going? I thought we were just getting acquainted.
Doctor? Doctor who?
Let me out of here!
Let me out!
Oi, Doctor! Let me out!
Let me out! Oi!
What is that thing?
Who are you?
You'll need the what? The worm? What worm?
Why would I run? I know what's going to happen next - and it's funny.
Your little pal, for a start. Ugly little fella, isn't he?
Then how come he's alive?
Neither am I.
Because these are the gauntlets, aren't they?
I don't understand how the snowman built itself. I'll run once you've explained.
Doctor who?
What's wrong with dangerous?
My snowman...
No, Doctor!  My snowman!
Yes.
I don't understand.
Is that going to happen again?
Unless I forget.
What about the snow? Shouldn't we be warning people?
Come on.
Hello.  Invisible.  An invisible staircase.
Look at that. Must have thawed in the night.
Elsie is back this afternoon - I was only helping out. I've got my own work to get back to.
You'd never believe me!
Alice, how smart you look today.
And how are the children? Excited about tomorrow?
Of course.  Every day?
That's better.
Captain Latimer.
In time for Christmas. Apologies for my brief absence - family illness is so unpredictable. You wanted to see me?
Young girls often do.
Perhaps if you asked her in the right way, there's no-one she'd rather tell.
They are, however, your children.
I'll see to the children now.
Ah, ah, ah!
Good morning, Francesca. Good morning, Digby.  Christmas Eve is the most thrilling day, don't you think? Now, what have you two been up to while I've been away?
Well, how exciting!
'Ello, mates!
Haven't you spoken to your father about this?
You could try.
Everything else has thawed, but this pond...  is still frozen.
Frannie, this is important. You dream about her. What do you dream?
When?
Doctor! Doctor!
Doctor!
I'm looking for the Doctor. Do you know about him?
Why?
Yes.
Curiosity.
Snow.
Yes.
Help.
Danger.
Kindness.
No?
Words.
Man.
Definitely not.
Because someone's coming to help.
You wouldn't believe me if I told you.
Huh! All my stories are true.
Accounting for my acute sense of time.
Because I dislike swimming alone.
There's a man called the Doctor. He lives on a cloud in the sky, and all he does, all day every day, is to stop all the children in the world ever having bad dreams.
He's been on holiday. But I am confident he has now returned to work.  And as a matter of fact, he's right here...  Aren't you, Doctor?
Bloomin' hell!
Get back, now, quickly.
Yes, love, did you notice?
RUN!
Frannie, Frannie, imagine her melting.
In your head, melt her.
Well, he's not, is he?
I don't know!
I'm very grateful. I knew you'd come.
What is it? What's wrong?
It's cooler.
No, the room. The room is getting colder.
The Ice Woman.
No.
Oh, I didn't listen.
It's why you like me.
I think you just did.
You blushed.
How?
What are you doing?
Doctor!
You were stupid, too!
Why does she keep saying that?
This way!
Agh!
My bustle is stuck.
I know. I understand, I do.
What's the plan?
Course you've got a plan. You took that.
You're not, you're clever. Really clever.
Is this a test?
What will it do to us?
I knew straight away.
Course I did.
Why should I?
If we'd been escaping, we'd be climbing down the building. If we'd been hiding, we'd be on the other side of the roof. But we're standing right here.
So!  After you.
After you, I'm wearing a dress. Eyes front, soldier!
Mine aren't.
No!
I understand you're the previous governess. I regret to inform you the position is taken.  Goodnight.
So you can move your cloud? You can control it.
She's following us!
That thing is after us, and you want a chat?
How did we get up so high so quick?
What am I standing on, what's this made of?
So you actually live up here? On a cloud, in a box?
Blimey, you really know how to sulk.
You live in a box!
Oh, spoken like a man! You're the same as all the rest. Sweet little Clara, works at the Rose and Crown, ideas above her station!  For your information, I'm not sweet on the inside, and I'm certainly not... little.
But it's... Look at it, it's...
It's smaller on the outside!
Is it magic? Is it a machine?
A ship?
Is there a kitchen?
I don't know why I asked that, it's just... I like making soufflÃ©s.
Why are you showing me all this?
You're nearly a foot taller than I am.  You could've reached the ladder without this  - you took it for me.  Why?
What's this?
I don't know why I'm crying...
Get off of me!
Get off!
Get off of me!
They all think I'm going to die, don't they?
How?
The green lady... she said you were the saver of worlds once. Are you going to save this one?
Yes.
Captain Latimer...  your children... they are afraid. Hold them.
It is now.
Salty. Salt water rain.
Will you go back... to your cloud?
Why not?
Run.
Run, you clever boy.  And remember.
Run, you clever boyâ€¦
and remember.
Shame. You're ashamed.
Where are we? How did we?
But the Daleks...
Shouldn't we be, um...? I don't want to say dead.
Why are you sharpening that stick?
So why am I tied up?
Where did he get that teleport thingy?
So, I'm guessing he uses the same energy as the android weapons, right?
OK, then. He uses the energy wave from the android weapons to recharge the teleport bracelet and at the exact moment he's supposed to disintegrate,
He actually teleports. Hang on, that's how you did it. That's how we escaped the Daleks.
So the androids think he's dead and the Doctor escapes.
Oh!
Because he's clever.
Because he always assumes he's going to win. He always knows there's a way to survive. He just has to go and find it.
We do.
We assume we're going to win.
Can I have a stick too?
What's happening?
He's in the middle of that?
Daleks have sewers?
Being?
They're what?
Too dark. Er, we could chuck a stone down, or something.
Oh!
Ah...
First chance I get.
You won't survive turning your back.
We're not a team.
You said it was a sewer.
So what is it all, then?
What is that? A lift?
What about it?
What is it?
What am I even looking for?
Why the hell did you do that?
What the hell did you do that for?
Missy. Missy. Missy, uncuff me now!
You can't kill a Dalek with a brooch.
What are you doing?
How am I supposed to make it go? Are there pedals?
Ow!
Ow.
What about when it comes out?
I don't know how to...
Oh! How did I do that?
I can't...
Hang on. No, Missy. No, no, no, no! No, Missy. Missy, no, no, no, please don't! Don't, don't, please!
Fine, I think.
OK.
Clara.
Clara Oswald.
I am Clara Oswald! I'm Clara Oswald!
I don't understand.
I love you.
You are different from me.
Exterminate!
Humanoid intrud...
What's happening?
No!
No!
Please, you can't just leave me here. Please!
It's me, I'm right here! It's me, I'm in here! It's Clara!
Yes, it's me, it's me. I'm right here.
No! Doctor, no! I'm not dead, I'm in here! Can you hear me?
I'm your friend. I'm your friend!
No, please, don't.
Because I would never kill you. You are the last person I would ever kill.
How?
Oh, Doctor...
Doctor!
Doctor, you don't have your screwdriver.
No! No? Seriously?
No chance you're going to tell me what's in that confession dial, I suppose?
Hmm.
What doesn't?
Doctor?
Hey! Hello?
Did you miss me?
Ha-ha! I've got a present for you.
No.
No.
It's not a  present.
OK, Evie Hubbard? Year Seven, you helped her out with her homework? Imaginary interview with Winston Churchill. You basically cheated.
Anyway, she got an A and so... she has sent you a selfie.
Come on...
I knew you'd be thrilled.
What's wrong?
Doctor?
So... Where are you going to take me?
Hmm... Somewhere... Somewhere magical. Somewhere new!
Well, don't worry, daft old man. I'm not going anywhere.
Hello. Oh, hello. Sandeep, hello. You OK?
Well, why don't you wait here, and I can go see if I can find them?
Hello? Hello?
Oh, sorry -- erm, your little boy is out there. He couldn't find you.
Is... Is he OK?
Did you just call yourself "Doctor Disco"?
A junior school?
Doctor, do you want to be alone with that thing?
Are you enjoying that?!
So, Osgood's been kidnapped, right? I thought Osgood was dead.
If you're not going to negotiate, what are you going to do?
It's in New Mexico.
It's a town in New Mexico -- Truth or Consequences. They renamed it after a TV show, for a bet or something. It's a Trivial Pursuit question. I used to memorise Trivial Pursuit questions so I could win.
Fine.
I thought you didn't like being President of the World.
How many troops do you have?
You got any snazzy weapons?
Where do you keep it?
Who took it?
Oh, I just need to swing by home and grab a couple of things.
It's really slow. We can catch them.  Come on!
It's slower than usual.
No.
I think we need to get some reinforcements.
It's always been an odd world.
You're middle-aged, that's what it is. No offence. Everybody middle-aged always thinks the world's about to come to an end. Never does. It's here. Oh, my God.
I think you might be right.
The end of the world.
OK. It looks like whole buildings full of people have been pinched. In fact, it looks like a whole London full of people have been pinched. But we've got here early, they're still growing. We've have to neutralise these before they hatch. Take your positions.
Do you know what? I'm enjoying this.
What?
Oh, come on. These are eggs, or pods, or whatever -- look. Oh, my God, that's me.
Look, they're here, they're growing duplicates of us. We have to destroy them. I've seen this happen before. It happened to that little boy, they took his parents and then they took him.
Kill the traitors.
Is he OK?
Copy that.
Bonnie speaking. UNIT neutralised in the UK. More or less.
Doctor.
There you are.
You're breaking up.
I'm sorry, but Clara's dead.
Truth or consequences.
You're breaking up!
Dream checks... Dream checks, dream checks...
Then why haven't you? Having trouble? Let's see what I can do.  See, this thing... works two ways, you know.
Trouble is, you're asking me for them, which means you can't access them, right?
No, you can't, otherwise you would have done already.
Go on, then.
I  calling your bluff. You need me alive.
Then you'd better start asking questions.
You see, that's your problem. I am a brilliant liar. How are you ever going to know?
Yes.
No.
UNIT HQ. Under the Tower of London.
The Black Archive.
The Osgoods.
The Doctor sealed it up after the last time. Didn't want UNIT interfering with the ceasefire.
The Doctor has access, too.
Yes.
I can't.
No, I'm not.
Obviously.
I told you. I can't. You  I'm not lying, I can't give you access.
It's automatic.
The door is keyed to my body print.
Yes.
The box ends the ceasefire.
There's a button inside the box. Press it, it will transmit a signal that will unmask every Zygon on the planet for up to an hour.
20 million Zygons against seven  humans -- that's not a war you can win!
Most of your own kind don't want that.
It's time you asked the most important question.
I'm waiting.
I'm not telling you.
I'm not telling you, because when you get to the Black Archive, you'll find out for yourself, and when you do, you're going to want to speak to me again. Am I lying to you?
See you later.
Mind what?
Uh... yeah, sure.  Take care, you!
What if he's really annoying?
Got ya.
So, you must have thought I was dead for a while?
How was that?
It could only have been five minutes!
What are these?
Sorry, but as you can see, I've got plans.
Look at me.
No, no, no. No. Look at me.
Seriously?
Got the words out. Not in the right order, but, hey... maths teacher!
Heels.
Right, got to go. Going to be late.
Bye!
There you go, you've got another playmate.
Well,  got it.
Is that her now?
Don't.
Because, if you answer it, something will happen.
A thing.
Doctor?
Where are we? How did we get here?
What happened to your face?
Did you see her face?
Your face, when we first saw you
You can replicate their clothes too?
We're actually going to do it? Rob the bank?
Question two, where  the TARDIS?
What about  guilt?
What's he doing?
No.
We've got to help him.
He's in agony, look at him.
What if the plan is, we're blowing up the floor for someone else? What if we're not supposed to make it out alive?
Psi.
Hey, Psi.
Doctor.
How does he get the cases here?
Well, how did he do that? And if he can do that, why does he need us?
You OK?
You can delete your memories?
I've got a few I wish I could lose.
You deleted your friends?
Your family?
How could you do that?
Oh, my God. Why is he even still alive?
OK. How do I not do that?
She's still in there. How do we get her out?
Then help her!
Hey. You OK?
Because Saibra...
Underneath it all, he isn't really like that.
Why?
Doctor? It's coming. We're trapped.
No, no.
You don't use that, OK? Promise me.
Argh.
It's not opening. Psi... he died for nothing.
And get two people killed.
Some logic?
How would he know  a storm would hit?
Of course, what?
Sorry, what?
Doctor? The code. The code that was in the last case. Look. Tech.
Tech.
Psi. That's what he came for, his reward.
She wanted to be normal.
PV.
Oh, my God.
What, for a private vault?
You're killing her? You just said
What?
Doctor, what's the plan? Is there a plan?
Are you remembering?
What? What is it? What are you understanding?
Which would be?
Soup?
Doctor!
It will kill you.
What?
What exactly are we doing here? That thing killed people.
Yeah, it's not really his area.
It's a date. You know, I've just realised. I'm going out for another meal now.
What? Are you kidding?
See you. Don't rob any banks.
Without me.
Emergency. You're my boyfriend.
No, no, you're not actually my boyfriend.
But I need a boyfriend really quickly.
No, shut up. Christmas dinner, me cooking.
So, I may have... accidentally invented a boyfriend.
No, not an android, a pretend one, an imaginary one. And I said he'd be coming to Christmas dinner.
Come for Christmas dinner. Just do that for me. Come to Christmas dinner and be my Christmas date.
I need you. I'm cooking Christmas dinner!
Well, can't we do both?
Great, yeah, yeah, it's doing great. Well, dead and decapitated, but that's Christmas when you're a turkey.
There you go, Gran.
Dad, I put it in when you phoned me.
Oh, you certainly did.
Whoops!
Doctor, I so need you...
No, stop, stop, don't move, don't do anything!
You're naked.
Doctor, why are you naked?
Oh, that was quick.
Still naked underneath?
Eugh, don't say things like that, it's Christmas. Come and meet my family.
Hello, so, er, here he is!
So... this is the Doctor. My boyfriend. Isn't anyone going to say hello?
So, to be clear, no-one except me can see your clothes?
Get in the kitchen!
Sorry... he's Swedish.
Doctor, please!
What's wrong? Do you not think it's done yet?
OK. Well, use an app.
On your screwdriver - app it.
Like what?
Ooh, vortex cooking?
What's that?
So, why haven't you just gone down there and had a look?
Doctor, are you OK?
Unless... unless you saved it. You thought you might have.
What's that?
A friend of yours?
Why?
What is it?
I don't feel like I'm wearing anything.
What is this place?
A security church?
So, er, hello! Also here!
No worries! You two get yourselves a room.
Boss of the psycho space nuns. So you!
Doctor?
I saw you and then I forgot you. How does that work?
What are you? Why do I keep forgetting you?
Wha...
Fine. Yeah, fine. Sorry.
Ah, great.
Oh, cold, very cold.
Oh, my God!
There's something under the snow, it's...
It's cold.
It's stone. It's just stone. It's only a statue.
What is it?
Only if I get it out of my shoe.
Good point.
I'm trying.
They're climbing out of the snow. Oh, God!
Why?
What are they doing here?
I can't. I can't see - the snow's in my eyes.
You can't fly it remotely.
But she took your key!
You've shaved your head?
You got bored one night, didn't you?
Is that what happened to your eyebrows?
Put it back on.
Your ears are like rocket fins.
Oh, it's good to be wearing clothes again. That's so much better, don't you think?
Or Daisy?
I'm an English teacher from planet Earth, and I've run off with a man from space because I really fancy...
Bubbly personality masking bossy control freak!
How can a town be called Christmas?
What's wrong? It's only a crack in the wall.
What is it?
Missed that!
That's good.
It does?
You said Gallifrey was gone.
The Time Lords? OK, so what then? If you answer the question, and they come back, what happens?
Why?
OK, is that it? Are you doing a clever thing?
Done.
No, don't you dare. No, no!
I... I was in space.
You tricked me.
You didn't even say goodbye.
Well, I am not even talking to YOU!
Oh, Doctor, fixing toys and fighting monsters.
Is it still asking the question?
What for?
Where do you get these?
It's beautiful. Why did you send me away?
No, you wouldn't. I would never have let you get stuck here.
Except you.
But you don't die. You change. You pop right back up with a new face.
OK, so you're number 11, so...
OK, so you're number 12.
Change the future.
You've got your TARDIS back.
Of course not. But you've been protecting this town for over 300 years. Do you not think it's anybody else's go yet?
It won't be you forever. It'll end the same way, whatever you do.
What about your life? Just for once, after all of this time, have you not earned the right to think about that? Sorry. Wrong thing to say. We shouldn't be having an argument.
But you didn't have your TARDIS.
It's gone dark.
Already?
She hasn't aged much.
What are those things?
Told who?
So this is sweet. Middle of a siege, and you two have little chats?
How did you stop them?
You'll kill me anyway. What difference does it make? I'm not afraid. I'll leave that to you.
What is?
Do you want some?
Got any plates?
One thing. Give me those big sad eyes, look at me so I know you're not lying, and tell me you will never send me away ever again.
Turkey smells good!
Perfect.
Merry Christmas.
Doctor?
I hate boy bands.
Tell us a joke, Gran. You know loads of jokes.
Probably not.
Sorry.
Everybody just stay put!
You can fly the TARDIS?
What's happened to him?
What am I supposed to do?
Clara.
Hello, Doctor.
Nah. That was you.
Merry Christmas.
Hey, it's OK.  It's fine, don't worry.
Extract from "Thoughts On A Clock" by Eric Ritchie Jr.
I don't think so.
"And now it's time for one last bow Like all your other selves Eleven's hour is over now The clock is striking twelve's."
Doctor, what are you going to do?
Doctor...
No!
Change it!
Like Tasha said, change the future!
Why?
Listen to me, you lot, listen! Help him. Help him change the future. Do it. Do something.
You've been asking a question... and it's time someone told you you've been getting it wrong.  His name... His name is the Doctor. All the name he needs. Everything you need to know about him. And if you love him... and you should... help him. Help him.
Get inside! Get off street, get inside, quick. Quick!
Doctor?
Doctor!
You're young again. You're OK. You didn't even change your face.
Who's coming?
You... you are the Doctor.
Who's Amelia?
No, no.
Please don't change.
Of your kidneys? What's happening?
Into what?
: Come on! we're on a roll!
Monsters, things blowing up. Oh, hey, can we go back to that place where the people with the long necks have been celebrating New Year for two centuries? I left my sunglasses there. And most of my dignity.
Here being...?
Is there a crew?
I want another adventure. Come on, you feel the same. You're itching to save a planet, I know it.
Doctor, look at this.
Food fight?
And they took provisions. OK, so something or someone forced the crew to abandon the base. Maybe they went for a swim in the creepy flooded village outside...
Oh, yeah. You see, this is more like it.
Oh, come on. Don't leave me hanging.
Are you sure?
What are they?
Where did they go? What is it, some kind of submarine?
Hey, look, they're back.
Wait, are they saying something?
OK, they now appear to be arming themselves.
I'm starting to see why the crew did a runner.
Run!
What is this place?
Morning?
Weird how that is not comforting.
What's the matter?
Doctor, wait, you're not saying...
You said there was no such thing. You actually pooh-poohed the ghost theory.
The cards.
Oh, come here.
Doctor?
Doctor, what's wrong?
Why? I don't understand.
So, what do we do?
Out there, where the action is.
What?
What do you mean? I'm not.
Wait, wait a second. You just raved about ghosts like a kid who had too much sherbet.
I really don't.
Doctor, I'm fine.
I know. And I appreciated it.
Which you take very seriously, I know.
Please. Please do.
Pritchard! Where you have you been? Everyone's been looking for you. What's with the wet suit?
Is he all right?
Bennett, wait! It's Pritchard.
He's a ghost. He's another ghost.
And now there's three of them.
Doctor, what do we do?
Hey! Hey, ghosts. Down here!
I'm beginning to think we should have let the ghosts in on the plan.
Doctor.
I'm fine, by the way, in case any of you were worried.
Doctor, you can't go in there, they will kill you!
It strengthens the signal. Another ghost, another transmitter.
A church?
What are we looking for, exactly?
So the pilot could be in there.
You took it apart and used the pieces to make a clockwork squirrel.
OK, so, the spaceship lands here. The pilot leaves the writing on the wall so whoever sees it, when they die, they become a beacon of the coordinates, while he slash she slash it snoozes in the suspended-animation chamber...
Come on!
Doctor!
Just come over here in the TARDIS now.
You can't just leave us!
They can't get out of the Faraday cage.
Guys, look, this is how we roll. He's going to go away, come back and we'll have to listen to how he did it.
No, I don't think it's any of them. I think it's a new ghost.
It means that something happened in the past, it means that somebody else must have. Oh, no. Oh, no, no, no, no.
